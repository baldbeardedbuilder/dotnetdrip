Let's talk about\r\nten Visual Studio Code extensions that every developer, regardless of language\r\nor platform, can benefit from using today.\r\n\r\n## Rest Client\r\n\r\n[![Rest Client in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/rest-client.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)\r\n\r\nIt's not hyperbole to say the Rest Client extension is a game-changer. If you\r\nregularly use REST APIs, you've undoubtedly used tools like Postman, Insomnia, or\r\nothers. Rest Client can replace all those by allowing you to make RESTful API\r\nrequests from within VS Code. One of the best parts is saving your requests\r\nas `.http` files with your code. Sending data, headers, and parameterized\r\nrequests are all possible. Check out the Extension Highlight I recently\r\nreleased on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/CLfz_CDnSV4) to see it in action.\r\n\r\n## Remote - Containers\r\n\r\n[![Remote - Containers in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/remote-containers.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)\r\n\r\nEven though it's been around for over a year, Remote - Containers is another\r\nextension that seems stuck in that \"Preview\" state. It allows you to use a\r\nDocker container as a full-featured development environment. Once your repository\r\nhas it configured, developers won't need to install 3rd-party SDKs or CLIs\r\nlocally to work with your codebase. I've given talks about developing inside\r\ncontainers and recently released an\r\n[Extension Highlight](https://youtu.be/Yo4wKXlnLMc) video on YouTube you can\r\ncheck out to learn more.\r\n\r\n## GitLens\r\n\r\n[![GitLens in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/gitlens.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)\r\n\r\nGitLens is a perfect name for our next extension. It provides a \"lens\" into data\r\nyou'd typically find in the Git CLI or GitHub website. Information like git\r\nblames, author data, and recent changes show within the code editor to give\r\nyou a short history of that piece of code. It also provides a powerful\r\nrepository view that gives you access to details that would cause you\r\nto leave the code editor to check out.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Pull Requests & Issues\r\n\r\n[![GitHub Pull Requests and Issues in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/github-pr.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of GitHub-related extensions, GitHub Pull Requests & Issues makes\r\nmanaging pull requests and issues much easier. Anything you can do with pull\r\nrequests in the browser can be done directly within VS Code. There's also\r\na great capability for checking out the pull requests code to run\r\nit locally. Imagine commenting on an issue or reviewing a pull request\r\nwithout leaving your development environment. That's just the tip of the\r\niceberg as far as this extensions' features. Check out the\r\n[Extension Highlight](https://youtu.be/VWbHiXN3mno) to see features.\r\n\r\n## Docker\r\n\r\n[![Docker in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/docker.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)\r\n\r\nIf you're using Docker containers, even if it's just with the Remote -\r\nContainers extension above, this extension is a must. It provides a great\r\nUI experience that is usually managed via the terminal. The Docker extension\r\nshows all containers, images, volumes, networks, and registries within the\r\nactivity bar then gives you the ability to fully manage them. Even\r\nright-clicking to enter a containers' shell.\r\n\r\n## YAML\r\n\r\n[![YAML in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/yaml.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)\r\n\r\nI wasn't at the meeting where everyone decided we would use YAML for DevOps,\r\nbut if you're looking to build continuous integration or deployment processes\r\ntoday, you're stuck with it. That being said, the YAML extension by Red Hat\r\nmakes dealing with YAML much easier. Like other extensions in this list, it's\r\nstill in \"Preview,\" but it works well enough that you should have this\r\ninstalled if you use YAML. I find myself using it to make sure my GitHub\r\nActions aren't ruined by simple spacing issues.\r\n\r\n## ESLint\r\n\r\n[![ESLint in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/eslint.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)\r\n\r\nIf you've ever built a project with a team, you know the experience of trying\r\nto manage style rules across team members. Many projects use ESLint to set\r\nexpectations and audit code in a project, but the ESLint extension brings\r\nthat capability all the way to the code editor. It displays linting errors\r\nin real-time as you're writing code, allowing you to make adjustments before\r\ncommits or pull requests.\r\n\r\n## Live Share\r\n\r\n[![Live Share in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/live-share.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)\r\n\r\nWith more teams working remotely, it's becoming increasingly important to\r\ncommunicate well. Live Share helps you quickly share your code, debug\r\nsessions, and more with others. You can allow them to join your development\r\nsession as a viewer or contributor and they experience the code base as\r\nif they were running it locally. In fact, they can debug remotely to help\r\nyou solve problems faster. Check out the\r\n[Extension Highlight](https://youtu.be/x53lUlTml5k) for more features.\r\n\r\n## Code Spell Checker\r\n\r\n[![Code Spell Checker in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/code-spell-checker.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)\r\n\r\nThere's no secret to the problem Code Spell Checker solves. Whether it's\r\nvariable names or comments, this extension looks over your shoulder to make\r\nsure you're spelling things correctly. Sure it helps with my code, but I see\r\nthe biggest benefit when writing documentation or blog posts like this one. I\r\nwrite all my posts &amp; most of my documentation in Markdown and inside VS\r\nCode. Code Spell Checker just makes sure I don't distract people from the\r\npoint I'm conveying with spelling mistakes.\r\n\r\n## Bracket Pair Colorizer 2\r\n\r\n[![Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 in the VS Code Marketplace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348237/blog/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-today/bracket-pair-colorizer-2.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)\r\n\r\nBracket Pair Colorizer 2 is the most straightforward extension of the\r\npack. Still, it solves an inconvenience that I've lived with for 20 years of\r\ndevelopment. When writing code that requires multiple pieces of code with\r\nnested parenthesis, square brackets, or curly brackets, it's easy to lose\r\nthe context of where you are in your code's logic.\r\nBracket Pair Colorizer 2 solves this by color-coding your parenthesis and\r\nbrackets to help you identify the context you're working in faster. There\r\nare several points of customization that I covered in an\r\n[Extension Highlight](https://youtu.be/p24vnBYWSQQ) that you can check out.\r\n\r\n## Wrap Up\r\n\r\nAre there VS Code extensions you can't live without?

This is the first time I've written a post over a period of days & weeks so hopefully it's all coherent at the end.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe reason I say \"my\" ultimate developer desk, is because we all have our own preferences for how we work best. Over the years I've found a few things that I prefer in my desk:\r\n\r\n## Length Over Depth\r\n\r\nMy arms aren't really long so I prefer a desk that isn't as deep. I like to be able to reach the back of my desk without a lot of reaching. However, I love having a long desk so I can put more on it without cramping my work area. So after taking some measurements of my current desk I finalized on a size of 7' (1.82m) x 27.5\" (698.5mm). This depth was also partially determined because I had decided to build with 2x6 boards. In the US, 2x6 boards have an actual size of 1.5\"x5.5\". So 5 boards would naturally create my depth without the need for cuts.\r\n\r\n## Strength for Mountings\r\n\r\nPreviously, I had 3 24\" monitors mounted to the wall behind my desk. I'm moving these to mounts on the desk itself so I can raise & lower it easier. Also, I recently purchased a new computer and want it on the desk rather than underneath. It's a behemoth at nearly 50 pounds (22.6kg) and will sit near the edge of the desk so strength will be important.\r\n\r\n## Technical Conveniences\r\n\r\nI'm a stickler for good cable management so it would be nice to include some way to manage cables within the desk that makes things look tidy. Also, the correct number of USB ports is always n+1 so I want to integrate a USB hub into the desk, ideally mounted flush with the desktop, so I can always have a spot to plug in something quick.\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't want to use a cable to charge my phone. That's so 2018. I want to integrate a wireless charger, maybe under the desk, so I can just set my phone in a specific area on the desktop to charge it while I work.\r\n\r\n## Motorized Sit/Stand Capabilities\r\n\r\nI've been spoiled in the past by the Ikea sit/stand desk and want that convenience again. I'm currently using a sit/stand desk but it's a very manual transition between those states so I want to automate it. Also, the monitors being mounted on the wall limits my current sit/stand flexibility so those are going to come to the desk.\r\n\r\n## Worn & Rustic Aesthetic\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I know the correct name for the design/style/whatever of my office. There's lots of wood, iron pipe, a ship-lap wall, and overall \"rustic/industrial\" vibe so I don't want a perfectly shaped & polished desk. My goal was to build something that looks a little worn and old.\r\n\r\n## Tools & Material\r\n\r\nThere weren't a lot of materials required. I already had all the screws needed so all I needed to purchase was the lumber, stain and, polycrylic. While I listed the tools I used below, it's important to know that all of them can be replaced with manual tools.\r\n\r\n### Materials\r\n\r\n- 5 - 2\"x4\"x8\" pine boards\r\n- 16 - 2\" screws\r\n- 10-ish - 1\" screws\r\n- 1 quart [Minwax Espresso Wood Stain](https://amzn.to/3glIXVe)\r\n- 1 quart [Minwax Polycrylic Matte Finish](https://amzn.to/3i58VMT)\r\n\r\n### Tools Used\r\n\r\n- Measuring tape\r\n- Speed square\r\n- Power drill driver\r\n- Power impact drill\r\n- Random orbital sander\r\n- Various clamps (12-30\" (304-762mm))\r\n- Miter saw (but any saw will do)\r\n- Kreg pocket-hole jig (Planned to use a biscuit joiner, but forgot I had one)\r\n- Foam brush (for stain & poly)\r\n- Couple of rags\r\n\r\n## Measuring & Measuring & Cutting\r\n\r\n![Two inch blocks sitting beside a miter saw that have been cut from the ends of two by sixes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649347962/blog/building-my-ultimate-rustic-developers-desk/1_gn0y3y.png)\r\n\r\nFirst up was cutting the boards to length. Because the ends of store-bought boards aren't always straight, I cut 2\" (50mm) off one end of each. Then I measured, marked, and cut one of the boards 7' (1.82m) from the straight end.\r\n\r\nRather than measure and mark the others, I used a square jig I had previously created on my tabletop with two scrap pieces of wood to square each one with the jig and cut board to mark the cut line. This made sure all boards were the same length and saved the time of measuring each board by hand. With each board cut to length, I was ready to glue them together.\r\n\r\nIf you want a perfectly flat top with no cracks between boards, you need to use a planer and jointer on each board to ensure they are identical. I really want a more rustic look so I don't want the boards perfectly flat/straight/even. I painstakingly checked the boards at the store for any warping or twists and was able to get some really straight boards that meshed well together.\r\n\r\n## Stuck On You\r\n\r\n![Boards laid on a table with clamps, wood glue and a drill sitting on them.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649347962/blog/building-my-ultimate-rustic-developers-desk/3_ztos4f.png)\r\n\r\nBefore I started the glue-up, I clamped a scrap board to my table that I knew was straight. Then I lined each board against it and reviewed how each board fit with those around it and compared their uniqueness to decide which boards should be in the front versus the back. Once I got each laid out where I liked them, I made some markings to add some pocket screws for stability.\r\n\r\n> I had originally planned to use glue and biscuits to align the boards, but when I got to the glue-up I forgot that I had the biscuits and a plate joiner. Because, you know... I'm a winner.\r\n\r\nOnce the marks were in place, I used my pocket-hole jig to create holes for the screws. Once they were all pre-drilled I glued the boards and quickly aligned and screwed them together to help hold them in place while the glue dried. The glue will provide more than enough strength to hold them together. The screws were more helpful for holding them while I worked and before I could clamp them all together.\r\n\r\nWith the glue and screws ready, I added clamps on both sides of the board to help ensure good contact across the boards and left them to dry for a day.\r\n\r\n## Sanding, Sanding & More Sanding\r\n\r\nI was really messy in my glue-up. I didn't bother to clean the joints between the boards or any runs. That meant I was going to have to do extra sanding to clean it all up. I ended up spending a couple days sanding the entire desk starting with 240 grit and working my way down to 80 grit.\r\n\r\n## Let's Be Extra\r\n\r\n![Collage of routed channels for a wireless charger and USB hub.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649347962/blog/building-my-ultimate-rustic-developers-desk/5_ucdvfo.png)\r\n\r\nHi. My name is Michael and I'm extra. I'm the guy who was being interviewed for a job and suggested they hire me because I have an animatronic puppet that would be great to control with their product. But hey, I hear the best way to overcome your issues is to first admit you have the problem.\r\n\r\nI saw a YouTube video a while back where someone had built a desk with a wireless charger mounted underneath. They could set their phone on the top of the desk and charge it while they worked.\r\n\r\nSo, inspired by that, I watched my behavior for the next week and found that 90% of the time I sat my phone directly in front of me in the middle of my desk. I purchased a wireless charger and drew its outline on the bottom of the desk where I'd expect my phone to rest. Then I used my router to cut out that piece of the desk and routed deep enough to only leave a quarter inch from the desktop to ensure the signal could get through. Finally, I routed a channel from that spot to the back of the desk where I could run the cable for the charger.\r\n\r\nNext, I bought a 7-port powered USB hub and following the same steps of picking a place for it to live, drew its outline on the desktop. I then measured its' depth and routed the top of the desk precisely to allow the USB to sit snugly in the hole and flush with the top of the desk. Once that was done, I did some measurements on the bottom of the desk to allow me to route an area on the end of where the USB hub would be sitting so its power and USB cables could come through and be routed to the back of the desk without hanging down.\r\n\r\n> Looking back I seriously have a problem. Before this project, I had never stained wood, used polycrylic, or built a desk. Heck, the little routing I had done was to make a hole for a battery pack for a LED strip mounted behind a guitar hanging on my wall. Why I thought I could do any of this, much less the complex routing required for the USB hub, is beyond me.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I was really worried about the routing. One wrong cut and the entire desk and all my work would have been wasted. Luckily it all fell in place and after a quick test fit of all the components, it was time to start the finishing work.\r\n\r\n## Make It Pretty\r\n\r\n![Stained desk with fresh coat of polycrylic applied and still drying.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649347962/blog/building-my-ultimate-rustic-developers-desk/7_snotgj.png)\r\n\r\nI spent some time at my local hardware store and picked a stain that I thought would match the rest of my office well. After a quick tutorial from the staff at the store, I set off to stain and poly the desk. First, I created two samples using some scrap wood and the stain with one and two coats. It really seemed like one coat provided the color I wanted and that was perfect because I'm lazy.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the stain with a foam brush, I let it sit for about 7-8 minutes and wiped the excess off with scraps of an old t-shirt. Then I let the stain dry for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nOnce it was dry, I applied the first coat of polycrylic with a foam brush. I picked out a matte finish to the polycrylic because I didn't want a glossy look to the desk. The polycrylic was solely for protection and not to shine. Every four hours, I applied another coat of polycrylic until I had 3 coats. Then I let it dry for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n## Finish Him\r\n\r\nI searched online for programmable motorized legs to use as the base. The key metrics I was looking for was the ability to have a wide base (as the desk was 7' long) and able to support 250+ pounds. The weight limit was the deciding factor in my choice because I knew that a real wood desktop, my PC, two monitors, etc would add up to a lot of weight for the motor to raise and lower.\r\n\r\nOnce the polycrylic was dry, I mounted it to the desktop and stood it up for the first time. Then it was just a matter of adding the wireless charger, USB hub, and then setting everything up in my office.\r\n\r\n![Finished desk assembled in my office.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649347962/blog/building-my-ultimate-rustic-developers-desk/9_qmwjvi.png)\r\n\r\n## What Did I Miss?\r\n\r\nI'm completely in love with this desk. The USB hub is such a time-saver. But, just like our code projects, I'm already planning the next version. Got any ideas on something I should add?

In simplest terms, Blazor allows\r\nyou to build web applications using C# instead of, or in tandem with,\r\nJavaScript _(sorry for using the \"J\"-word.)_ With Blazor, you can build\r\nfeature-complete apps with reusable web components that make it easy to\r\nisolate UI design, functionality, and testing.\r\n\r\nBecause you're writing C#, you can use any .NET libraries that conform to the\r\n[.NET Standard](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard). That\r\nmeans most of the packages you would pull from [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/)\r\ncan be included in your application. But the first choice you have to make\r\nis what flavor of Blazor you want to use.\r\n\r\nBlazor can run your C# application in the browser, using WebAssembly, or on\r\nthe Server. Both have pros/cons that should be considered depending on the\r\nuse-case of your application.\r\n\r\n## Blazor Server\r\n\r\nAll Blazor Server code, including Razor pages, are compiled into libraries\r\nthat run, as the name implies, on the server. When clients visit the\r\napplication, they receive a page with a little JavaScript that initiates\r\na connection to the server via\r\n[SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr).\r\n\r\nThe server then uses that websocket connection to send small payloads to\r\nthe client that updates the page. This allows users to experience fast\r\nload &amp; render times, but also means that every visitor has a\r\npersistent bi-directional connection to the server. You'll definitely want\r\nto take that into consideration when thinking about scaling your application.\r\n\r\n### Server Pros\r\n\r\n**Render &amp; Load Times**\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest positives of Blazor Server is load &amp; render times.\r\nSince users aren't downloading the runtime or application libraries, they\r\ncan start using the application faster.\r\n\r\n**Ease of On-Boarding**\r\n\r\nGetting started with Blazor Server is much faster because you're writing\r\nthe same C# code you would regardless. As long as your code conforms to\r\n.NET Standard 2.0, your existing classes, data-access, business logic,\r\netc. will just work. Because all the code runs on the server, it also\r\nmeans you don't have to build a separate front-end and back-end.\r\n\r\n**Browser Support**\r\n\r\nUnlike WASM, Blazor Server is supported in all major browsers because it\r\ndoesn't require the browser to support WebAssembly. This is a major\r\nconsideration if you still need to support users with IE 11 or other older\r\nbrowsers.\r\n\r\n### Server Cons\r\n\r\n**No Offline Support**\r\n\r\nBlazor Server is not going to be the right fit for you if you're looking\r\nto add offline support for your users. Since each page &amp; component\r\nare served from the server, no code is maintained on the client.\r\n\r\n**Page Load/Change Latency**\r\n\r\nWhen changes need to be made to the UI, Blazor Server recognizes and sends\r\nthe diff down to the client to update the presented UI. This is much faster\r\nthan full page reloads, but can cause latency on the round-trip. You'll want\r\nto be mindful of the datasets you're passing around to minimize the size of\r\nthe diff being sent.\r\n\r\n**Scalability**\r\n\r\nScalability isn't necessarily a \"con\" for Server Blazor, but it is something to\r\nconsider. Since every visitor has a separate websocket connection to the\r\nserver, the amount of memory consumed by the application per user may require\r\nscaling hardware more quickly than Blazor WASM.\r\n\r\n**Servers Not Included**\r\n\r\nBecause your site will be running server-side, you will need something to serve\r\nyour application and handle requests. Serverless options are available, but\r\nprocessing is handled server-side and not client-side, so all logic, etc. must\r\nbe handled there.\r\n\r\n## Blazor WebAssembly\r\n\r\n> [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) defines\r\n> WebAssembly, or WASM, as a \"low-level assembly-like language that provides\r\n> near-native performance that allows other languages to run on the web.\"\r\n\r\nBlazor WebAssembly is a single-page app (SPA) framework for building\r\nclient-side web applications with .NET. Developers can write C# and utilize\r\ncode that already exists in their back-end applications like models, business\r\nlogic, and more. When a Blazor WASM app is built, all your C# code and Razor\r\nfiles are compiled into .NET assemblies that are downloaded to and run in\r\nthe client's browser.\r\n\r\nIf you've had experience with the popular JavaScript frameworks, Blazor WASM\r\nwill feel very familiar.\r\n\r\n### WASM Pros\r\n\r\n**Fast User Experience**\r\n\r\nOnce loaded, the user experience is blazing fast (pun intended.) With your\r\ncode running in the browser, the UI will feel nearly instantaneous for users\r\nother than calls to external APIs.\r\n\r\n**Offline Support**\r\n\r\nBlazor WASM allows you to build applications that users can still use when\r\ntheir internet connection isn't available. Your apps can also take a hybrid\r\napproach to allow certain parts of your site to be accessible offline but not\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n**Servers Not Needed**\r\n\r\nBecause your Blazor WASM code can run offline, your app can be delivered via\r\na CDN. This effectively removes the need for a server to host your application.\r\nIf your application requires a back-end API, those would still need to live on\r\na server.\r\n\r\n**.NET Standard 2.0 Is Ready To Go**\r\n\r\nAny .NET Standard 2.0 code can run in a Blazor WASM application. That means,\r\nin most cases, the internal &amp; external libraries your app depends on will\r\nwork as they do today.\r\n\r\n### WASM Cons\r\n\r\n**Initial Load Time**\r\n\r\nThe most often mentioned downside is the initial payload size. All Blazor\r\nWASM apps bootstrap the .NET runtime. While Microsoft has made gains in\r\ntrimming this down, it can still result in a large initial download for\r\nclients. One way the compiler tries to help is by tree-shaking unused code\r\nwith the Intermediate Language Trimmer.\r\n\r\n**API**\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with data or things that need to be secured, you'll need to\r\nmake calls to an API. This is a paradigm that's popular with exiting\r\nJavaScript frameworks and is likely familiar to C# developers who have\r\nbuilt with ASP.NET MVC.\r\n\r\n## Other Observations\r\n\r\nIf you're used to existing JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, React, or\r\nAngular, then you'll understand the paradigm that Blazor WASM uses. It\r\njust sprinkles in the magic of C# for .NET developers.\r\n\r\nBlazor Server will be an easier entry point for WinForm &amp; XAML\r\ndevelopers. I hesitate to compare it to WebForms because it is **NOT**\r\nWebForms, but it seems like an evolution from that world. It's all\r\nC# developers wanted WebForms to be.\r\n\r\nThe choice of which to use will be dependent on several factors, but\r\nan important one will be: _\"where will my code &amp; user state live?\"_\r\n\r\nIf you choose Blazor Server, you will want to be mindful of what kind\r\nof state you're maintaining for each user. Blazor Server handles state\r\nwell, but the size and scope of that state are controlled by you. The\r\nlarger state, the fewer users per server you'll be able to support.\r\n\r\nWith Blazor WASM, that state remains on the client-side but requires\r\nyou to use back-end APIs for data access and sensitive processes.\r\n\r\nLuckily, both use components that work in both flavors. This means that\r\nswitching between the two isn't a daunting task and can be very simple\r\nwith the right architecture.\r\n\r\nHopefully, you now have a better understanding of the features &amp;\r\nlimitations of Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly. I'd love to\r\nhear about what you're building.

The benefit to the stream is that viewers can see the process we use\r\nto submit pull requests, our branching strategies, etc. However, for those that want to\r\njoin in on the fun later, it's likely that their pull requests will be directed to the\r\nwrong branch or perhaps for an issue that is already in progress by another contributor.\r\n\r\nTo help, I went on a search for example `CONTRIBUTING.md` files across GitHub. There\r\nwere several great examples. A few are:\r\n\r\n- [PurpleBooth](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426)\r\n- [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [Factory Bot Rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nI modified thoughtbot's Factory Bot Rails version to meet my needs and added it to all my\r\nactive public repositories. You can see an example in our\r\n[Aviary](https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aviary/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) repo.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, your CONTRIBUTING.md should include details about:\r\n\r\n- What type of contributions are permitted? (documentation/code/ideas/tests/examples/etc.)\r\n- Instructions for adding issues\r\n- Instructions for forking & submitting pull requests\r\n\r\nThis basic information gives potential contributors a little more confidence about\r\nsubmitting that pull request by alleviating the fear they'll be blasted for using the\r\nwrong base branch.\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nI'll admit I'm a little knew to this one. I'm not sure I've ever read a repositories Code of\r\nConduct before this week. It's easy to overlook when you expect the best from people and/or\r\nhaven't experienced the effects of poor conduct when participating in public repo communities.\r\nBut the fact that I've never personally experienced something doesn't mean I should overlook\r\nthat bad behavior in the development community does exist. In fact, regardless of\r\nmy personal experiences, I want everyone to feel included and safe to share ideas and collaborate.\r\n\r\nHaving a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in your public repository lets potential contributors know in\r\nadvance how they can expect to be treated by the community and maintainers.\r\n[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is a great resource for a Code\r\nof Conduct for your repository.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledging Contributions\r\n\r\nI love new contributors! It makes my day when I get a notification that someone created an\r\nissue, submitted a pull request or even just forked the repository. There are several ways to\r\nshow love for your contributors but one I've recently implemented (and love) is the\r\n[All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) specification.\r\n\r\nWhen someone contributes I simply comment on an issue or pull request and the\r\nAll Contributors bot creates a pull request that gives that person an acknowledgement\r\non our README.md.\r\n\r\nAn example from our VS Code extension is:\r\n\r\n![Example of the bottom of our README's with contributors.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137023/blog/code-of-conduct-and-contributions-in-public-repositories/58047645-3cb89880-7b0e-11e9-8270-7fd116460102_ve78fr.jpg)\r\n\r\nNot all contributions are code.

This post is a contribution to [C# Advent 2021](https://www.csadvent.christmas/). Be\r\n> sure to visit and read all the excellent content focused on C# and the .NET community.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n\r\nBefore we get too deep in the how-to, let's talk about the need I was trying to\r\naddress. Today, Deepgram has two fully supported SDKs; Node.js &amp; Python.\r\nLike .NET, both are great languages with solid ecosystems, but I wanted to\r\nprovide that first-class citizen experience to my beloved .NET developers. 😁\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of planning, I landed on the following requirements for the SDK:\r\n\r\n- Enable access to all the publicly available endpoints of the [Deepgram API](https://developers.deepgram.com/api-reference/)\r\n- Allow users to provide their own logging by using the [LoggerFactory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loggerfactory) provided in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` library\r\n- Ensure the library was accessible to as many frameworks &amp; platforms as reasonably practical\r\n\r\n## Calling the API\r\n\r\nMost of the Deepgram API is accessible via HTTP requests, so the library handles\r\nthose as you'd expect with an HTTPClient. Requests to transcribe audio in\r\nreal-time are handled via WebSockets. Creating a reusable and well-managed\r\nWebSocket client was more challenging because I couldn't find any real-world\r\nexamples in the documentation. In most cases, the documentation would show\r\nconnecting to a socket, sending a message, receiving a message, and then\r\ndisconnecting. In the real world, I needed a client that would connect, then\r\nsend &amp; receive messages on-demand, and disconnect at a later time that I\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n## Bring Your Own Logging\r\n\r\nLogging, like tests, are one of those features that developers like to bypass.\r\nFor years, my projects were scarce on logging and, when included, it was\r\noften added as an afterthought. That said, I was very impressed by one of my\r\ncolleagues, [Steve Lorello](https://twitter.com/slorello), at Vonage, who worked\r\non their .NET SDK. Not only did he do a great job with logging throughout the\r\nSDK, he utilized the `LoggerFactory` to provide the ability for developers to\r\nchoose their own logging solution. I contacted him as I was getting started to\r\nwarn him that I was blatantly plagiarizing his work. 😂\r\n\r\nLuckily, Steve was super gracious and offered to help with any questions.\r\nSeriously, if you aren't following Steve on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slorello),\r\nyou should. He's doing outstanding work at Redis now.\r\n\r\n## Microsoft's Cross-Platform Recommendations\r\n\r\nMicrosoft recommends starting with a `netstandard2.0` target. Since we only plan\r\non supporting platforms &amp; frameworks that can use .NET Standard 2.0 or later,\r\nI started reviewing any dependencies I had added intending to strip it down\r\nto only those compliant with the .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n\r\nI did notice in [Microsoft's recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/cross-platform-targeting)\r\nthat in some cases, you may have to shield your users depending on their platform\r\nand framework, as in the example below:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static class GpsLocation\r\n{\r\n    // This project uses multi-targeting to expose device-specific APIs to .NET Standard.\r\n    public static async Task\u003C(double latitude, double longitude)> GetCoordinatesAsync()\r\n    {\r\n#if NET461\r\n        return CallDotNetFramworkApi();\r\n#elif WINDOWS_UWP\r\n        return CallUwpApi();\r\n#else\r\n        throw new PlatformNotSupportedException();\r\n#endif\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Allows callers to check without having to catch PlatformNotSupportedException\r\n    // or replicating the OS check.\r\n    public static bool IsSupported\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n#if NET461 || WINDOWS_UWP\r\n            return true;\r\n#else\r\n            return false;\r\n#endif\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFortunately, our SDK didn't require these types of workarounds.\r\n\r\n## Publishing to Nuget with GitHub Actions\r\n\r\nBecause I created the library in Visual Studio 2022 using the new class library\r\ntemplates, the configuration for building a NuGet package was as painless as\r\nproviding details like the name, description, etc. of the package. I had already\r\ncreated a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-dotnet-sdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml)\r\nto perform CI tasks, so I decided to add another GitHub Action to deploy the\r\npackage to NuGet.org when a new version was released.\r\n\r\nThe Continuous Deployment (CD) action contains two jobs: `build` and `publish`.\r\nThe `build` job creates the NuGet package, while the `publish` job\r\nhandles uploading the generated package to NuGet.org. The `publish` job will\r\nonly run if the `build` job completes successfully. You can review the entire\r\nCD workflow file [here](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-dotnet-sdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/CD.yml).\r\n\r\n### Triggering a New Release\r\n\r\nOnce we're ready to release a new version of the SDK, we create a new GitHub\r\nrelease. The CD action is triggered when that new release is published. Once\r\nit begins, we use the `actions/checkout@v2` to check out the code based on the\r\nsha associated with the release.\r\n\r\n### Restoring Dependencies\r\n\r\nOnce the repository is retrieved, we install .NET 6 and install any\r\nrequired dependencies from NuGet.\r\n\r\n### Identifying Version Number\r\n\r\nOnce the dependencies are installed, the next step pulls the version number from\r\nthe GitHub release and outputs that value so that subsequent steps can access\r\nit.\r\n\r\n### Building &amp; Packaging the SDK\r\n\r\nNext, the action calls `dotnet pack` and passes various parameters to configure\r\nthe build and packing process to ensure we've got the cleanest output\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n#### --configuration\r\n\r\nThe `--configuration` parameter tells the build process to run in `Release`\r\nmode rather than `Debug` mode.\r\n\r\n#### --no-restore\r\n\r\nBecause we previously ran `dotnet restore` in the action, there's no need to\r\nrestore packages from Nuget during the build process. The `--no-restore`\r\nparameter tells the build process to skip this step to save time.\r\n\r\n#### --output\r\n\r\nOnce we build the SDK with the various targets, we want that clean output saved\r\nto a specific directory. In our case, the `./dist` directory.\r\n\r\n#### -p\r\n\r\nThe `-p` parameter is used to pass additional parameters to the build process.\r\nIn our case, we are sending a parameter called `Version` and set it to the value of\r\nthe `get_version` step, which returned our version number based on the GitHub\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\n### Archiving Packing Artifacts\r\n\r\nThe generated package should live in the ./dist directory when the build and\r\npacking process completes. We use the `actions/upload-artifact@v2` action to\r\nsave the contents of that directory as an artifact of the action with the name\r\n`dist`. We'll access this artifact in the next step of the process.\r\n\r\n### Publishing to NuGet\r\n\r\nWith the package archived as an artifact, the `publish` job will send it\r\nto NuGet.\r\n\r\n#### Downloading Artifacts\r\n\r\nThe publish job will first download the artifact named dist that was created in\r\nthe build job. These artifacts are downloaded to the `./dist` directory.\r\n\r\n#### Pushing the Package\r\n\r\nNext, the job calls `dotnet nuget push` to send any .nupkg file in the `./dist`\r\ndirectory to NuGet.org. This requires an access token that NuGet provides.\r\nFor securities sake, we store that token in the repositories secrets and access\r\nit via `${{secrets.NUGET_API_KEY}}`.\r\n\r\nWith that step complete, the action is finished and stops. NuGet will review\r\nthe uploaded package and release it to the marketplace automatically.\r\n\r\n## Announcing the Deepgram .NET SDK\r\n\r\nOf course, with all this work completed, we can announce the new\r\n[Deepgram .NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Deepgram/). Try it out, and\r\nlet us know if it helps you get up and running with Deepgram even faster.\r\n\r\nAlso, the entire project has been\r\n[built in the open on GitHub](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-dotnet-sdk),\r\nand we'd love your input, feedback, and contributions to make it even better!\r\nHappy building!","src/content/blog/cross-platform-nuget-dotnet.md","cfaf3be78cf45aff",{"html":249,"metadata":250},"\u003Cp>I love the .NET ecosystem.

In the real world, I needed a client that would connect, then\r\nsend &#x26; receive messages on-demand, and disconnect at a later time that I\r\ndecide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"bring-your-own-logging\">Bring Your Own Logging\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Logging, like tests, are one of those features that developers like to bypass.\r\nFor years, my projects were scarce on logging and, when included, it was\r\noften added as an afterthought.

After reviewing multiple sites explaining varying ways to allow the two containers to communicate we finally found the correct solution. So, for our future reminder, and possibly a chance to help others:\r\n\r\n## Setting up the Docker-Compose File\r\n\r\nWhile the wind-up for this post has been huge, actually getting the docker-compose right is fairly straight forward.\r\n\r\nFirstly, add your two services in the docker compose like so:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n\r\nversion 3.4\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  iotapp:\r\n    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}iotapp\r\n    build:\r\n      context: .\r\n      dockerfile: *path to your app Dockerfile here*\r\n    ports:\r\n      - {external port}:{internal port}\r\n    links:\r\n      - api\r\n  api:\r\n    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}api\r\n    build:\r\n      context: .\r\n      dockerfile: *path to your api Dockerfile here*\r\n    ports:\r\n       - {external port}:{internal port}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the **links** flag in the iotapp service. This lets Docker know that iotapp will need to be able to communicate with the api project.\r\n\r\nPretty simple right?\r\n\r\nThe missing piece of the puzzle for us was how to communicate between the two.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in our iotapp code, it is hardcoded to communicate with `http://localhost:{port}/api`. However, this won't be okay because the api & iotapp containers each have their own \"localhost\". After much experimenting and several incorrect StackOverflow &amp; Google responses, we found you must call the name of the service specified in the docker-compose. So any call in our iotapp to `http://localhost:{port}/api` needed to be changed to `http://api:{port}/api`.\r\n\r\nSeeing what's required and the \"how-to\", it makes complete sense, but this one stumped me for several hours. Hopefully if you're reading this Google has sent you and it saves you that time.\r\n\r\nAnything I missed or that we could do better?

To help manage building release notes our team built a PowerShell script that accesses the GitHub &amp; Octopus Deploy API's to determine what commits have occurred between the latest deployed release and the current build.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n## The Background\r\n\r\nIn most cases, we use the same CI process for our clients.\r\n\r\n- Each commit is built in [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com)\r\n- Depending on the branch/tag, the artifacts of the build are loaded to [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/)\r\n- Octopus sends it all out to the appropriate environments\r\n\r\n## The Setup\r\n\r\nTo get everything working together, we have to setup each system to work together.\r\n\r\n### Octopus Deploy\r\n\r\nI'll assume you've already setup environments in Octopus Deploy so I won't go into that. The only thing you really need from Octopus is a few bits of data that we'll use in the PowerShell script later. You'll need:\r\n\r\n- The url of your Octopus server\r\n- A username &amp; password\r\n- An API key\r\n- The name of the project we'll be using for deployments\r\n- The name of the environment used for production\r\n\r\n### GitHub\r\n\r\nLike Octopus, we only need a few bits of info so we can access the GitHub API via the PowerShell script. You'll need:\r\n\r\n- The name of the owner of the repository\r\n- The name of the repository\r\n- A personal access token ([How-to from GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/))\r\n\r\n### The Repository\r\n\r\nOur repositories will normally have a _build_ folder with a release-gen.ps1 file. Then, in our appveyor.yml, we'll add the following to each build process:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ninstall:\r\n  - ps: Invoke-Expression ./build/release-gen.ps1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the top of the release-gen.ps1 file are the variables that you'll need to set based on the items we mentioned above.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$global:github_owner = \"GitHub Owner Name Here\"\r\n$global:github_repo = \"GitHub Repo Name Here\"\r\n$global:github_token = \"GitHub Personal Access Token\"\r\n\r\n$global:octopus_url = 'Url to Octopus Deploy'\r\n$global:octopus_username = \"Octopus Deploy Username\"\r\n$global:octopus_password = ConvertTo-SecureString \"Octopus Deploy Password\" -AsPlainText -Force\r\n$global:octopus_apikey = \"Octopus Deploy API Key\"\r\n$global:octopus_projectName = \"Octopus Deploy Project Name\"\r\n$global:octopus_productionEnvironment = \"Name of Production Environment in Octopus Deploy\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bringing it all together\r\n\r\nNow that everything is setup let's talk about the script and what it does. It's actually a simple process that saves us a lot of time.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a build in AppVeyor, the script calls to your Octopus Deploy API and identifies what version (which should correspond to a tag in GitHub) is deployed to the production environment. It then calls the GitHub API and gets a list of all commits between the current commit or tag and the current version in the production environment.\r\n\r\nThen, with that list of commits we build both HTML &amp; markdown versions of the release notes. The HTML version is passed to Octopus with the build artifacts. The markdown version is sent to GitHub with the build artifacts.\r\n\r\n![Sample Markdown look at generated release notes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137025/blog/automating-release-notes-with-git-hub-app-veyor-and-octopus-deploy/48307475-14befb80-e513-11e8-85fb-b50ec28751b2_nndjdm.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Sample HTML look at generated release notes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137026/blog/automating-release-notes-with-git-hub-app-veyor-and-octopus-deploy/48307489-69fb0d00-e513-11e8-8f8c-a86359d90494_snm6ke.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Important Notes\r\n\r\n### Skipping commit messages\r\n\r\nThere are certain commit messages that the script looks for and doesn't add to your release notes. Any commit that starts with \"merge\", \"merging\" or \"private\" aren't included. This allows our developers to prefix any commits that don't complete an issue with \"Private:\" to ensure they won't get included in the release notes.\r\n\r\nWhen the final commit is made the developer will enter a quality commit message that describes exactly what their work has accomplished.\r\n\r\n### Issue numbers\r\n\r\nOur team is committed to adding close messages to our final commits when they close an issue. (i.e. Did some kind of fix. Closes #430)\r\n\r\nThe script identifies the pattern of Closes #{issue number} or Fixes #{issue number} and modifies it to make the issue number a link to that issue in GitHub. So that line on the release notes will have both a link to the commit and links to any issues denoted in the commit message.\r\n\r\n## Download the full script\r\n\r\nYou can check out the full script at [https://github.com/MichaelJolley/release-notes-script](https://github.com/MichaelJolley/release-notes-script).

It's\r\nuseful for avoiding naming conflicts between libaries or for using simpler\r\nnames for complex generic types. If you're not familiar with namespace and type\r\naliasing, here is an example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Namespace alias\r\nusing SuperJSON = System.Text.Json;\r\nvar document = SuperJSON.JsonSerializer.Serialize(\"{}\");\r\n\r\n// Type alias\r\nusing SuperJSON = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer;\r\nvar document = SuperJSON.Serialize(\"{}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New Aliasable Types\r\n\r\nWith the release of C# 12, developers are gaining the ability to alias almost\r\nall types. Let's review some of the new options.\r\n\r\n### Aliasing Tuple Types\r\n\r\nTuples are commonly used as method return types, but when they're used multiple\r\ntimes, aliasing can help us keep our code cleaner and more legible.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Country = (string Abbreviation, string Name, double GDPPerCapita);\r\n\r\nCountry GetCountry(string abbreviation)\r\n{\r\n    // Logic here\r\n    return (\"US\", \"United States of America\", 63529);\r\n}\r\n\r\nList\u003CCountry> GetCountries()\r\n{\r\n    // Logic here\r\n    return [(\"US\", \"United States of America\", 63529)];\r\n}\r\n\r\nConsole.WriteLine(GetCountry(\"US\").Name);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Aliasing Types with Pointers\r\n\r\nMost of time, C# developers don't need access to pointers, but now you can alias\r\nthem when you do.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing bytePtr = byte*;\r\n\r\nunsafe void MyMethod()\r\n{\r\n    int x = 1024;\r\n    bytePtr ptr = (byte*)&x;\r\n\r\n    Console.Write(\"The 4 bytes of the integer:\");\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0 ; i \u003C sizeof(int) ; ++i)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.Write(\" {0:X2}\", *ptr);\r\n        ptr++;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine();\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"The value of the integer: {0}\", x);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Aliasing Array Types\r\n\r\nAliased array types are another addition in C# 12, which should make your\r\ndeclarations cleaner and more legible for teams.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Companies = System.Collections.Generic.List\u003CCompany>;\r\n\r\nCompanies GetCompanies()\r\n{\r\n    return [\r\n        new Company() { Id = 1, Name = \"Acme Co.\"}\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Company\r\n{\r\n    public string Name;\r\n    public int Id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Aliasing Nullable Types\r\n\r\nMost types are available for aliasing in C# 12, including nullable value types.\r\nHowever, nullable reference types aren't available for aliasing.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nExpanded capabilities for aliasing in C# 12 has the potential to make your code\r\ncleaner and more readable for your teams.","src/content/blog/alias-any-type-in-csharp-12.md","17ea9af3b55f18b5",{"html":451,"metadata":452},"\u003Cp>C# has had the ability to alias namespaces and named types for a long time.

It felt like an easy step to the web for WinForm developers,\r\nbut it abstracted much of how the internet works. As a result, .NET developers\r\ndidn't think about things like HTTP verbs or payload size.\r\n\r\nMany of those developers, myself included, got a little \"closer to the metal\"\r\nwhen Microsoft officially released ASP.NET MVC in early 2009. My mind really\r\nenjoyed the MVC pattern for building web applications & APIs. Though there have\r\nbeen several improvements to the framework since, developers who have left the\r\n.NET world will still feel familiar with the conventions of the latest\r\niteration.\r\n\r\nThat said, the past several years have seen an explosion of development shifting\r\nto the web and APIs are popping up everywhere. While .NET developers were\r\npreviously limited to MVC, the introduction of Minimal API and other non-MS\r\n.NET API frameworks is providing them with a plethora of options.\r\n\r\nLet's review a few of those options to help you choose the best option for\r\nyour API needs.\r\n\r\n> **A quick note about the code snippets below:** These snippets do not contain\r\n> all the code needed to run the APIs. I've purposely not shown code related to\r\n> Entity Framework DbContexts or POCO classes. They do include the code that\r\n> ASP.NET uses to build the `/todoitems` routes for retrieving all and one\r\n> `ToDoItem`.\r\n\r\n## Controllers\r\n\r\nControllers have been the \"bread and butter\" of .NET API building for a long\r\ntime. Their structure is familiar to all .NET developers; even those that are\r\njust now working on web-based projects.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\n\r\nnamespace TodoApi.Controllers;\r\n\r\n[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class TodoItemsController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    private readonly TodoContext _context;\r\n\r\n    public TodoItemsController(TodoContext context)\r\n    {\r\n        _context = context;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // GET: api/TodoItems\r\n    [HttpGet]\r\n    public async Task\u003CActionResult\u003CIEnumerable\u003CTodoItemDTO>>> GetTodoItems()\r\n    {\r\n        return await _context.TodoItems\r\n            .Select(x => ItemToDTO(x))\r\n            .ToListAsync();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // GET: api/TodoItems/5\r\n    [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\r\n    public async Task\u003CActionResult\u003CTodoItemDTO>> GetTodoItem(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        var todoItem = await _context.TodoItems.FindAsync(id);\r\n\r\n        if (todoItem == null)\r\n        {\r\n            return NotFound();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return ItemToDTO(todoItem);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding attributes to properties, methods, and classes makes it relatively\r\npainless to add support for routing, authentication/authorization, or building\r\nSwagger and OpenAPI documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you're building an API that requires Swagger or OpenAI documentation, one\r\nhuge benefit is support for reading code comments into that documentation. This\r\nmakes it super easy for documentation to become part of the product itself.\r\n\r\nOf course, your scenario is rarely as basic as the example above and\r\nunfortunately, most Controller-based API examples use the pattern of injecting\r\nan Entity Framework context and manipulating it within the endpoint method. For\r\nmore complex applications, you'll probably be injecting your own services with\r\nbusiness logic customized to your needs.\r\n\r\nOne \"con\" of the approach of Controller-based APIs, is that dependency injection\r\noccurs at the controller level. While this does mean your service, DbContext,\r\netc. are available to all methods within the controller, it also means that the\r\napplication may be spinning up resources that your particular web request may\r\nnot need. However, that overhead is usually one of the last places you need to\r\nstart optimizing.\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit of Controller-based APIs is the built-in support for\r\ngenerating Swagger and OpenAPI documentation based on your code comments and\r\nclass attributes.\r\n\r\n## Minimal API\r\n\r\nMinimal API is a newer approach to building APIs with ASP.NET Core and its\r\nfluent syntax is very appealing to developers coming from the JavaScript and\r\nPython worlds. In fact, after spending the past few years building applications\r\nwith TypeScript, I found Minimal API a much simpler path to onboard to .NET\r\nAPIs.\r\n\r\nHere is the same two API endpoints shown above, but written using Minimal API:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\n\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nbuilder.Services.AddDbContext\u003CTodoDb>(opt => opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"TodoList\"));\r\nbuilder.Services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\nvar todoItems = app.MapGroup(\"/todoitems\");\r\n\r\ntodoItems.MapGet(\"/\", async (TodoDb db) =>\r\n    await db.Todos.ToListAsync());\r\n\r\ntodoItems.MapGet(\"/{id}\", async (int id, TodoDb db) =>\r\n    await db.Todos.FindAsync(id)\r\n        is Todo todo\r\n            ? Results.Ok(todo)\r\n            : Results.NotFound());\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sure you immediately notice the conciseness of Minimal API. One benefit to\r\nusing Minimal API is the granularity of control over the construction of your\r\nendpoints. While both of the endpoints have a `ToDoDb` DBContext injected, you\r\ncan probably imagine a world where different services are provided to different\r\nendpoints.\r\n\r\nAs for documentation, Minimal API does support Swagger and OpenAPI documentation\r\ngeneration, but the process for documenting endpoints is more invasive than the\r\nController-based method. For instance, to modify the `/` route above to include\r\na summary and description of the endpoint, you'd need to use the `WithOpenApi`\r\nfluent method as shown below.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\ntodoItems.MapGet(\"/\", async (TodoDb db) =>\r\n        await db.Todos.ToListAsync())\r\n    .WithOpenApi(operation => new(operation)\r\n    {\r\n        Summary = \"This is a summary\",\r\n        Description = \"This is a description\"\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're not returning [TypedResults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.typedresults?view=aspnetcore-8.0), you'll need to document the response types of your\r\nendpoint. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\ntodoItems.MapGet(\"/\", async (TodoDb db) =>\r\n        await db.Todos.ToListAsync())\r\n    .Produces\u003CIList\u003CTodo>>();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## FastEndpoints\r\n\r\n**Bonus Time!** In addition to the Microsoft-supported methods above, many\r\ncommunity frameworks exist for building APIs with .NET.\r\n[FastEndpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com/) is an option I found recently that\r\nseems very promising. With performance benchmarks that put them on par with\r\nMinimal API, they are firmly ahead of Controller-based APIs.\r\n\r\nAlso like Minimal API, FastEndpoints uses a fluent-based approach to\r\nconfiguration. However, one major difference is found in how endpoints are\r\ncreated. While the Minimal API framework expects many endpoints to exist within\r\na class and be organized within a `MapGroup`, the FastEndpoints convention\r\nexpects each endpoint to live within its own class.\r\n\r\nThose `Endpoint` classes also define the request and response signatures via DTO\r\nclasses. Using FastEndpoints, our two endpoints would look like the below\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n```csharp title=AllToDoEndpoint.cs\r\npublic class AllToDoEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest\u003CIEnumerable\u003CTodoItemDTO>>\r\n{\r\n    public TodoContext _context;\r\n\r\n    public override void Configure()\r\n    {\r\n        Get(\"/api/todoitems\");\r\n        AllowAnonymous();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override async Task HandleAsync(MyRequest req, CancellationToken ct)\r\n    {\r\n        var todoItems = await _context.Todos.ToListAsync();\r\n        await SendAsync(todoItems);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp title=GetToDoEndpoint.cs\r\npublic class GetToDoEndpoint : Endpoint\u003CIdRequest, \r\n                                        Results\u003COk\u003CTodoItemDTO>, \r\n                                                NotFound>>\r\n{\r\n    public TodoContext _context;\r\n\r\n    public override void Configure()\r\n    {\r\n        Get(\"/api/todoitems/{Id}\");\r\n        AllowAnonymous();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override async Task\u003CResults\u003COk\u003CTodoItemDTO>, NotFound>> ExecuteAsync(\r\n        IdRequest req, CancellationToken ct)\r\n    {\r\n        var todoItem = await _context.Todos.FindAsync(req.Id)\r\n\r\n        if (todoItem is null)\r\n        {\r\n            return TypedResults.NotFound();\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        return TypedResults.Ok(todoItem);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class IdRequest\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Swagger & OpenAPI documentation, you'll use fluent methods within the\r\nendpoints `Configure` method.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic override void Configure()\r\n{\r\n    Get(\"/api/todoitems/{Id}\");\r\n    AllowAnonymous();\r\n    Description(b => b\r\n        .Produces\u003CTodoItemDTO>(200, \"application/json+custom\")\r\n        .ProducesProblemDetails(404, \"application/json+problem\"); //if using RFC errors \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne big bonus that FastEndpoints provides is a large collection of supported\r\nfeatures, including model binding, rate limiting, caching, pre/post processors,\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n## Which is Right for You?\r\n\r\nIf you have a background in JavaScript, Python, or Functional programming,\r\nMinimal API will feel more natural to you. But if you've spent a lot of time\r\nusing .NET for the web or WinForms, you'll likely find Controllers more\r\naccessible.\r\n\r\nAnother point of consideration is documentation. While it's possible to document\r\nyour API via Swagger or OpenAPI with all three, unless you enjoy documenting\r\nyour endpoints using fluent methods, you'll likely find writing Controller-based\r\nAPIs less cumbersome to manage.\r\n\r\nIn the end, all are valid and welcome additions to the .NET ecosystem. You truly\r\ncan't go wrong with any of them and I'd recommend building with all three to\r\nfind what works best with your existing application patterns and processes.","src/content/blog/choosing-between-dotnet-controllers-and-minimal-apis.md","4194a30d4879f983",{"html":495,"metadata":496},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>This post has been included in the 2023 edition of \u003Ca href=\"https://csadvent.christmas/\" target=\"_blank\">C# Advent\u003C/a>.

For instance, to modify the \u003Ccode>/\u003C/code> route above to include\r\na summary and description of the endpoint, you’d need to use the \u003Ccode>WithOpenApi\u003C/code>\r\nfluent method as shown below.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"csharp\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">todoItems.\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">MapGet\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"/\"\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, \u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\">async\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">TodoDb\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\"> db\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) \u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\">=>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\">        await\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> db.Todos.\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">ToListAsync\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">())\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    .\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">WithOpenApi\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">operation\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\"> =>\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\"> new\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(operation)\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    {\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">        Summary \u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\">=\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"This is a summary\"\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">        Description \u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\">=\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"This is a description\"\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    });\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Also, if you’re not returning \u003Ca href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.typedresults?view=aspnetcore-8.0\">TypedResults\u003C/a>, you’ll need to document the response types of your\r\nendpoint.

However, one major difference is found in how endpoints are\r\ncreated.

You knew you were about to find\r\nthe answers you'd been searching for. Then it happened. You saw the dreaded 404\r\nerror letting you know that the content you were looking for wasn't there. Maybe\r\nthe content lives at a new location or perhaps it's been permanently removed.\r\nRegardless of the reason, your high hopes have been dashed and you're left to\r\nbegin your search again.\r\n\r\nIt's a terrible experience and one we wanted to make better. But before we get\r\ninto the details of what we've done, let's talk about where the idea started.\r\n\r\n## To Those About to Hack, We Salute You\r\n\r\nAt Deepgram, we have a goal that every interaction with us should be pleasant\r\nand (hopefully) enjoyable. We spend a lot of time thinking of how to make that\r\nhappen. One of the methods we use for brainstorming ideas and gathering feedback\r\nis hosting internal hack-a-thons (known internally as GRAMJAMs.) Last year, 8\r\nteams competed to be the GRAMJAM champion and one of the entries was a super\r\nfun game called MadGab.\r\n\r\n![GRAMJAM 2021 logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650409604/blog/building-404-pages-that-bring-joy/gj2021.webp)\r\n\r\nThe premise was simple: present the user with a nonsensical phrase that is\r\nphonetically similar to a real-life phrase. Players would read the nonsensical\r\nphrase aloud and attempt to then say the associated real-life phrase. An example\r\nwould be \"mass turk hard\" in the place of \"Mastercard.\" It was a great\r\nexperience. The game's format was simple to understand and perform and it was\r\nhighly addictive. We knew immediately that we had to make this available for\r\nothers. This brings us back to the 404 page.\r\n\r\n## Making it Helpful\r\n\r\nWe knew we couldn't just have a game on our 404 page. While it's a fun\r\ndistraction, we realized that the visitor came with a purpose. That purpose\r\nneeded to be our number one priority. How could we help them reach their\r\nobjective?\r\n\r\n### Can We Find What You're Looking For?\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great if we could \"guess\" what you were looking for and provide\r\nyou with a link to it? Fortunately, as we've built our site, we've tried to do\r\na good job of creating routes that consist of keywords associated with the\r\ncontent of the page. This means we can assume that parsing a route (even one\r\nthat resulted in a 404) should provide keywords that are relevant to what the\r\nuser was trying to reach.\r\n\r\nWe then send those parsed words to Algolia to search our site and display the\r\nthree most relevant results to the user. With a little luck, the results shown\r\nwill provide the information the visitor was looking for and they're only a\r\nclick away from continuing their journey.\r\n\r\n![Search results on the 404 page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650411275/blog/building-404-pages-that-bring-joy/results.webp)\r\n\r\n### Quick Access to Search\r\n\r\nWhat if there were no results or the results didn't meet the user's need. Without\r\nadditional information, we can't move the user forward. So we added a search\r\ninput to the page to give quick access to finding what they're looking for. Yes,\r\nwe have a search bar on the top of every page in the navigation, but we don't\r\nwant users to expend unnecessary brain power trying to find it. Putting the\r\nsearch input front-and-center allows them to be on their way as efficiently as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n![Search bar on the 404 page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650409604/blog/building-404-pages-that-bring-joy/search-bar.webp)\r\n\r\nNow that we've done all we can to provide relevant information and paths\r\nforward, let's try to brighten their day by providing a chance to have fun\r\nbefore they move on.\r\n\r\n## Making it Enjoyable\r\n\r\nAfter some brainstorming, we had a list of requirements to recreate MadGab on\r\nour platform:\r\n\r\n- Any API keys should remain on the server, or be short-lived (i.e. less than 5 minutes)\r\n- Store the collection of gibberish phrases/answers on the server to protect them from cheaters 😁\r\n\r\nWe hope to open-source MadGab in the future, but, for now, I'll share how we\r\nachieved the goals above.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the MadGram game on our 404 page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650409604/blog/building-404-pages-that-bring-joy/madgram.webp)\r\n\r\n### Protecting API Keys\r\n\r\nMadGab connects to the Deepgram API via a WebSocket and sends audio from the\r\nusers' microphone to be transcribed. This requires us to send an API key in the\r\nheader of that connection. That means an API key will be exposed to the client.\r\nTo minimize any risk, we wanted to use short-lived API keys. Because the\r\ndeveloper platform is hosted on Netlify, functions seemed like a good option for\r\nproviding a way to create a temporary API key to use for the game.\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, the Deepgram API allows creating API keys with a specified\r\ntime-to-live. So we imported the Deepgram Node SDK and use it to create a key\r\nthat lives for 5 seconds. That's just long enough for our front-end to connect\r\nto the Deepgram API before it expires. Below is the code for the Netlify\r\nfunction that generates and returns the API key.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { Deepgram } = require('@deepgram/sdk')\r\nrequire('dotenv').config()\r\n\r\nconst deepgram = new Deepgram(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)\r\nconst deepgramProjectId = process.env.DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID\r\n\r\nexports.handler = async function (event, context) {\r\n  try {\r\n    const key = await deepgram.keys.create(\r\n      deepgramProjectId,\r\n      'Temp 404 key',\r\n      ['member'],\r\n      {\r\n        timeToLive: 5,\r\n      }\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      statusCode: 200,\r\n      body: JSON.stringify(key),\r\n    }\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    console.log(err)\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      statusCode: 500,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### No Peeking at the Answers\r\n\r\nOur teams at Deepgram had already collected a list of phonetic phrases matched\r\nwith the actual word phrases, so we were able to use that list in the game.\r\nWhile we could have created an array of those phrases in our component, we\r\ndidn't want users to be able to find them in the code and cheat. To solve this,\r\nwe created another Netlify function that could be called to return phrases\r\non-demand.\r\n\r\nEach phrase is defined as an object with three properties:\r\n\r\n- `id`: a unique identifying number for the phrase\r\n- `suggestion`: the phonetic phrase\r\n- `result`: the phrase to be spoken\r\n\r\nTo prevent the need to call the function after every round of the game, the\r\nfunction returns up to three phrase objects at a time. However, we don't want to\r\nsend the same phrase to the same user until they've played every phrase\r\navailable. This requires us to track which phrases the user has played on the\r\nclient side. Then, each time we request new phrases, we'll send an array of the\r\nID's of each phrase the user has played in the body of the request. So the first\r\nthing the function should do is ensure the request is sent via HTTP `POST`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Only allow POST\r\nif (event.httpMethod !== 'POST') {\r\n  return {\r\n    statusCode: 405,\r\n    body: 'Method Not Allowed',\r\n    headers: {\r\n      Allow: 'Get',\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, it will parse the request body to get the id's of the phrases the user has\r\nalready attempted.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst userChoices = []\r\nif (event.body !== undefined) {\r\n  const req = JSON.parse(event.body)\r\n  userChoices.push(...req.choices)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, our phrases are stored in an array inside the function and called\r\n`choices`. So the next step is to filter the `choices` array to remove any\r\npreviously used phrases. If we've reached the end of choices, then we restart the\r\ngame and begin sending previously used phrases again. We'll also set the\r\n`restart` variable to true and return that as well. This notifies the\r\nclient-side that we've restarted and it should clear its cache of previously\r\nused phrases.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet restart = false\r\nconst availableChoices = choices.filter((f) => !userChoices.includes(f.id))\r\nif (availableChoices.length === 0) {\r\n  availableChoices.push(...choices)\r\n  restart = true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we want to select three random choices from `availableChoices`. To do that,\r\nwe created a `getRandomChoice` function that can return a random phrase from\r\n`availableChoices`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction getRandomChoice(availableChoices) {\r\n  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableChoices.length)\r\n  return availableChoices.splice(randomNumber, 1)[0]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we can call that function three times to gather the three phrases to return\r\nto the client-side. If less than three phrases remain, we just return the\r\nremaining phrases.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (availableChoices.length > 3) {\r\n  selectedChoices.push(getRandomChoice(availableChoices))\r\n  selectedChoices.push(getRandomChoice(availableChoices))\r\n  selectedChoices.push(getRandomChoice(availableChoices))\r\n} else {\r\n  selectedChoices.push(...availableChoices)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we return the `selectedChoices` array and the `restart` boolean to the\r\nclient-side.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn {\r\n  statusCode: 200,\r\n  body: JSON.stringify({\r\n    restart,\r\n    choices: selectedChoices,\r\n  }),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Better Experiences are a Core Value\r\n\r\nAt the heart of this project is a desire to provide a better experience for\r\ndevelopers. Our team at Deepgram spends a LOT of time focused on how to make\r\nthat happen. From the experience of signing up, working in our console, using\r\nour SDKs, and yes, even our 404 page. We want every encounter with Deepgram to\r\nbe informative, helpful, and pleasant. So while 404 pages interrupt your flow of\r\nwork, hopefully, these changes empower you to find what you need faster, while\r\nalso providing an enjoyable experience.","src/content/blog/building-404-pages-that-bring-joy.md","97a2cae2093fb05e",{"html":530,"metadata":531},"\u003Cp>You clicked on that link with high expectations.

Then, each time we request new phrases, we’ll send an array of the\r\nID’s of each phrase the user has played in the body of the request.

How can we make discovering endpoints and capabilities easier?","> I am insanely thankful to be included in \u003Ca href=\"https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/The-Third-Annual-csharp-Advent\" target=\"_blank\">C# Advent\u003C/a> this year. This is the 3rd year of C# Advent and I always enjoy the dozens of posts by everyone in the community. Be sure to follow the link above and check out the other posts and watch `#csadvent` on Twitter for updates.\r\n\r\nRESTful APIs are very popular these days. When used consistently, they provide a great way to make our APIs easier\r\nfor users to consume. But how can we make discovering endpoints and capabilities easier? One way is to implement\r\nHypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS). You may have seen HATEOAS used in other APIs without\r\nrealizing it.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet's look at two responses from RESTful APIs:\r\n\r\n![Example code of a JSON result from a RESTful and RESTful + HATEOAS API](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137021/blog/adding-hateoas-to-an-asp-net-core-api/header-templatssse_uzfqri.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the example responses, you can see that by adding the `links` property to your object, you can greatly increase the discover-ability of your RESTful APIs.\r\n\r\nLet's add a rudimentary implementation of HATEOAS in an ASP.NET Core web API.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nFirst, download the sample code in this \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aspnetcore-hateoas\" target=\"blank\">GitHub repository\u003C/a>.\r\n\r\nThe solution contains two C# projects: BaldBeardedBuilder.HATEOAS.Lib (Lib) and BaldBeardedBuilder.HATEOAS (API).\r\n\r\n### HATEOAS.Lib (Lib)\r\n\r\nWe're not going to go into much detail about the Lib project, but I want to provide a little context to how it's used.\r\nIts sole purpose is to provide an example data access layer. The Lib project contains a small Entity Framework Core DbContext\r\nwith two related DbSets; Clients and Addresses. The solution will use an in-memory database and will seed it each time you debug.\r\n\r\n### HATEOAS (API)\r\n\r\nThe API project is where all of our HATEOAS magic happens, but before we get into those details, let's take care of some housekeeping.\r\n\r\nAs we mentioned previously, we're using an in-memory database for Entity Framework Core (EF). We're also using AutoMapper to map our EF entities to the API models. To get those things setup we'll first add an `AutoMapping.cs` file to the root of the API project with the following code:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class AutoMapping : Profile\r\n{\r\n    public AutoMapping()\r\n    {\r\n        CreateMap\u003CAddress, AddressModel>();\r\n        CreateMap\u003CClient, ClientModel>();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code will create the AutoMapper maps between our EF entities and models. With that file in place, we'll update our `Startup.cs`'s `ConfigureServices` method with the following:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nservices.AddAutoMapper(typeof(Startup));\r\nservices.AddDbContext\u003CBBBContext>(options =>\r\n    options.UseInMemoryDatabase(databaseName: \"bbb\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Preparing Our Models\r\n\r\nBefore we can add links to our models, we need to define what they look like. Many times objects will have links that\r\nallow for navigation to related objects. You may even see links related to functionality like CRUD and other operations.\r\nIn our example, we'll add links for relational objects, including `_self`. The `_self` link will define the path to that\r\nspecific object. In the `Models` directory of the API project, let's add a `Link.cs` file with the following class:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Link\r\n{\r\n    public Link(string href, string rel, string type)\r\n    {\r\n        Href = href;\r\n        Rel = rel;\r\n        Type = type;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public string Href { get; private set; }\r\n    public string Rel { get; private set; }\r\n    public string Type { get; private set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we'll add a base class that our future models will inherit from. Add a new `RestModelBase.cs` file to the `Models` folder of the API project with the following:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic abstract class RestModelBase\r\n{\r\n    public List\u003CLink> Links { get; set; } = new List\u003CLink>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that base class in place, we'll inherit it in our `AddressModel` and `ClientModel` classes.\r\n\r\n### Adding a Controller Base Class\r\n\r\nWe'll handle adding the links to each object in a new `RestControllerBase`. Add a `RestControllerBase.cs` file to the `Controllers` folder of the API project. It should inherit from `ControllerBase`.\r\n\r\nNow add a constructor that receives an IActionDescriptorCollectionProvider and IMapper as shown below.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate readonly IReadOnlyList\u003CActionDescriptor> _routes;\r\nprivate readonly IMapper _mapper;\r\n\r\npublic RestControllerBase(\r\n    IActionDescriptorCollectionProvider actionDescriptorCollectionProvider,\r\n    IMapper mapper)\r\n{\r\n    _routes = actionDescriptorCollectionProvider.ActionDescriptors.Items;\r\n    _mapper = mapper;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we'll add a method that will create URIs for each link. The `URLLink` method receives the relation as a string that you will specify. Examples would be \"\\_self\", \"addresses\", etc. It also takes in the name of the route in MVC. These will be defined later when we build our API controllers. Finally, the method takes in an object of values that will contain our route values. Add the following to the `RestControllerBase.cs`.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\ninternal Link UrlLink(string relation, string routeName, object values)\r\n{\r\n    var route = _routes.FirstOrDefault(f =>\r\n                            f.AttributeRouteInfo.Name.Equals(routeName));\r\n    var method = route.ActionConstraints.\r\n                            OfType\u003CHttpMethodActionConstraint>()\r\n                            .First()\r\n                            .HttpMethods\r\n                            .First();\r\n    var url = Url.Link(routeName, values).ToLower();\r\n    return new Link(url, relation, method);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can add methods to generate links for each of our models. In the repository you'll see two methods, `RestfulAddress` and `RestfulClient`, that do this work. We'll look through the `RestfulClient` method to describe what we're doing.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\ninternal ClientModel RestfulClient(Client client)\r\n{\r\n    ClientModel clientModel = _mapper.Map\u003CClientModel>(client);\r\n\r\n    clientModel.Links.Add(\r\n        UrlLink(\"all\",\r\n                \"GetClients\",\r\n                null));\r\n\r\n    clientModel.Links.Add(\r\n        UrlLink(\"_self\",\r\n                \"GetClientAsync\",\r\n                new { id = clientModel.Id }));\r\n\r\n    clientModel.Links.Add(\r\n        UrlLink(\"addresses\",\r\n                \"GetAddressesByClient\",\r\n                new { id = clientModel.Id }));\r\n\r\n    return clientModel;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `RestfulClient` method above, we take in a Client object and convert it to a ClientModel with AutoMapper. Then we add links for \"all\", \"\\_self\" and \"addresses\" paths.\r\n\r\nThe \"all\" relationship will provide a link to our API method that returns all clients. The \"\\_self\" relationship defines where this client can be retrieved from the API. The \"addresses\" relationship defines where to find the addresses associated with this client. Each of the methods we define in those links ('GetClients', 'GetClientAsync' and 'GetAddressesByClient') will be defined later in our ClientController.\r\n\r\n### Adding Controllers\r\n\r\nNow that our base controller is done, let's add a `ClientController.cs` that inherits from our `RestControllerBase` class. First, we'll define a constructor and inject everything our base class needs as well as our DbContext.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate readonly ILogger\u003CClientController> _logger;\r\nprivate readonly BBBContext _bbbContext;\r\n\r\npublic ClientController(\r\n    ILogger\u003CClientController> logger,\r\n    IActionDescriptorCollectionProvider actionDescriptorCollectionProvider,\r\n    BBBContext bbbContext,\r\n    IMapper mapper)\r\n    : base(actionDescriptorCollectionProvider, mapper)\r\n{\r\n    _logger = logger;\r\n    _bbbContext = bbbContext;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can access our database to retrieve data and return it using the `RestfulClient` method of our base class.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpGet(Name = \"GetClients\")]\r\npublic IActionResult GetClients()\r\n{\r\n    IEnumerable\u003CClient> clients = _bbbContext.Clients;\r\n    IEnumerable\u003CClientModel> clientModels = clients\r\n                                            .Select(f => RestfulClient(f));\r\n\r\n    return Ok(clientModels);\r\n}\r\n\r\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\", Name = \"GetClientAsync\")]\r\npublic async Task\u003CIActionResult> GetClientAsync(Guid id)\r\n{\r\n    if (id == Guid.Empty)\r\n    {\r\n        return BadRequest();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Client client = await _bbbContext.Clients.FindAsync(id);\r\n\r\n    if (client == null)\r\n    {\r\n        return NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return Ok(RestfulClient(client));\r\n}\r\n\r\n[HttpGet(\"{id}/addresses\", Name = \"GetAddressesByClient\")]\r\npublic IActionResult GetAddressesByClient(Guid id)\r\n{\r\n    if (id == Guid.Empty)\r\n    {\r\n        return BadRequest();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    IEnumerable\u003CAddress> addresses = _bbbContext.Addresses\r\n                                                .Where(w =>\r\n                                                    w.ClientId.Equals(id));\r\n    IEnumerable\u003CAddressModel> addressModels = addresses\r\n                                                .Select(f =>\r\n                                                    RestfulAddress(f));\r\n\r\n    return Ok(addressModels);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur `AddressController` will also inherit our `RestControllerBase` and its constructor will match the `ClientController`. Then we can add the following methods for our `/api/addresses` routes:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[HttpGet(Name = \"GetAddresses\")]\r\npublic IActionResult GetAddresses()\r\n{\r\n    IEnumerable\u003CAddress> addresses = _bbbContext.Addresses;\r\n    IEnumerable\u003CAddressModel> addressModels = addresses\r\n                                                .Select(f =>\r\n                                                    RestfulAddress(f));\r\n\r\n    return Ok(addressModels);\r\n}\r\n\r\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\", Name = \"GetAddressAsync\")]\r\npublic async Task\u003CIActionResult> GetAddressAsync(Guid id)\r\n{\r\n    if (id == Guid.Empty)\r\n    {\r\n        return BadRequest();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Address address = await _bbbContext.Addresses.FindAsync(id);\r\n\r\n    if (address == null)\r\n    {\r\n        return NotFound();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return Ok(RestfulAddress(address));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne thing to notice on these controller methods: each is provided a `Name` attribute. These names\r\ncorrespond to the `routeName`'s we pass into the `UrlLink` method. The `UrlLink` method will use\r\nthat method's template to generate the URL to that route.\r\n\r\n### Wrap It Up\r\n\r\nNow that everything is in place, we can run the application and navigate to the `/api/clients` route\r\nto retrieve a list of clients. Those clients should have a `links` property with links you can follow\r\nto retrieve additional data or perform various actions.\r\n\r\nRemember that links don't only have to provide URI's to related data, but can also provide URI's to\r\nperform tasks. Some implementations include links for CRUD operations with relations like `client-update`,\r\n`client-delete`, etc.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this basic implementation of HATEOAS gives you some ideas of how you can implement something\r\nsimilar in your own API's to improve their discoverability.

I feel like I need another type of light behind me to better illuminate the green screen to improve the chroma-key. I've actually been debating moving one of the key lights to the center front and moving the other behind me to illuminate the green screen.\r\n\r\nI've been using the [Logitech C922x Webcam](https://amzn.to/2ErynLP) for my primary video. It seems to do well and I'm currently using Xsplit Vcam software to handle the background removal. I purchased the webcam based on feedback from other streamers and haven't been disappointed with it.\r\n\r\nFor the audio I'm using an [Audio-Technica AT2020](https://amzn.to/2E6Z9HS) condenser microphone with a pop filter. That runs into a [Focusrite Scarlett Solo](https://amzn.to/2U3ACKv) USB audio interface and into the PC from there. I've been really happy with the mic. Our company uses MS Teams heavily with its call/video recording and I use this mic exclusively now rather than a headset mic.\r\n\r\n## Other Hardware\r\n\r\nMy streams have really been focused on IoT development and I've found it difficult to display what's going on with my [Raspberry Pi](https://amzn.to/2EhMOkr)'s video onto the stream. So far I've been limited to only displaying an SSH window to the Pi. So a new addition to the family is the [Elgato HD60 Pro](https://amzn.to/2XhXwQl) game capture card. This receives an HDMI input and shows in OBS as a video source that I can share on the stream.

Then [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) turned me on to the [iPazzPort Wireless Mini Handheld Keyboard/Touchpad](https://amzn.to/2Npx0jt).\r\n\r\nThis is a mini-keyboard with a built in touch pad that is a _MUST HAVE_ if you work with devices like the Raspberry Pi at all. It's only $14 so it was a no-brainer purchase.\r\n\r\nThe final piece of hardware that I'm constantly finding uses for (even when not streaming) is the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://amzn.to/2Er27bE). This little device is a wonder and with the new SDK released by Elgato I have a feeling an ecosystem of extensions/add-ons are about to spring up around this guy.\r\n\r\n## Software\r\n\r\nI'm not using a ton of software, but here's the rundown:\r\n\r\n- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for scenes and actual recording/streaming. Also do some audio filtering here, though that is very much still a work in progress.\r\n- [Elgato Game Capture for Windows](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/downloads) to capture the input from the HD60 Pro.\r\n- On my stream, you'll see alerts &amp; widgets provided by [StreamLabs](https://streamlabs.com/). They make it easy to add customized alerts to your stream.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat's the current run-down. I hope to expound more on my findings as I work to improve the audio/video production of the stream so future streamers can get there faster. In all, I've really enjoyed live-coding on stream.

I assume if what you need is pressing enough you'll call back or send me a text message. But maybe there are times I'd want to know who called and what they needed. In that case, I need to receive that information in one of the channels I normally check, like email.\r\n\r\nSo I built a workflow that allows people to call and leave me a message that will automatically be transcribed and emailed to me. This tutorial will show you how to build the same workflow using Twilio Studio, Pipedream, and Deepgram.\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\nFirst, we'll create a Twilio Studio Flow that will handle all calls to a Twilio Voice number. That Flow will ask the caller to leave a message, then send the recording to Deepgram for transcription. Twilio Studio is a low-code workflow builder that allows you to build workflows that connect to Twilio's APIs and other third-party APIs.\r\n\r\nOnce the transcription is complete, Twilio will send a webhook to a Pipedream workflow with information about the transcription. Pipedream is a low-code integration platform that allows you to build workflows that connect to hundreds of third-party APIs.\r\n\r\nPipedream will make a request to the Twilio API to get the actual transcription, format it, and send it to my email address. Then, we can use the transcription to respond to the caller.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore we get started, make sure you have the following:\r\n\r\n- A Twilio account. Sign up for a free account [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).\r\n- A Twilio phone number. You can get one [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming).\r\n- A Pipedream account. Sign up for a free account [here](https://pipedream.com/auth/signup).\r\n\r\n## Creating a Twilio Studio Flow\r\n\r\nFirst, let's create a Twilio Studio Flow that will trigger when a call is received. This Flow will ask the caller to leave a message, then send the recording to Deepgram for transcription. The name of your Flow doesn't matter. I named mine \"Transcribe Voicemail.\"\r\n\r\n![Twilio Studio New Flow dialog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813645/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/new-twilio-studio-flow-dialog_yem6xt.webp)In the next prompt, choose the \"Start from scratch\" option and press the \"Next\" button. This will create a blank Flow.\r\n\r\n![Twilio Studio New Flow dialog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813646/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/twilio-studio-new-flow-type-dialog_b2bob7.webp)\r\n\r\n### Play a Message when a Call is Received\r\n\r\nNow that we have a new Flow, let's add a widget to prompt the caller to leave a message. In the widget library, click and drag the \"Say/Play\" widget into the Flow. Be sure to connect the \"Incoming Call\" trigger to the new widget.\r\n\r\nNext click on the \"say_play_1\" widget in your Flow and change the \"Text to Say\" field to \"Hello. Leave a message please.\" Then click the \"Save\" button. At this point, your Flow should look like this:\r\n\r\n![Twilio Studio Say/Play widget config](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813647/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/twilio-studio-say-play-widget-config_ubhc6e.webp)\r\n\r\n### Record the Callers Message\r\n\r\nNow that we've prompted the caller to leave a message, let's add a widget to record the caller's message. In the widget library, click and drag the \"Record Voicemail\" widget into the Flow. Be sure to connect the \"Say/Play\" widget's \"Audio Complete\" output to the new widget.\r\n\r\nNext click on the \"record_voicemail_1\" widget in your Flow and change the \"Trim\" field to \"Trim silence\" and the \"Play Beep\" field to \"True\". This will remove silence at the beginning and end of the recording and provide a beep prompt for the caller to begin speaking. Click the \"Save\" button. At this point, your Flow should look like this:\r\n\r\n![Twilio Studio Record Voicemail widget config](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813646/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/twilio-studio-record-voicemail-widget-config_bnppp4.webp)\r\n\r\n### Configuring Your Twilio Phone Number\r\n\r\nThe Flow now has everything it needs to record a caller's message. But we need to configure our Twilio phone number to use this Flow. In the Twilio console, click on the \"Phone Numbers\" link in the left sidebar. Then click on the phone number you want to use for this Flow.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Voice & Fax\" section, click on the \"A Call Comes In\" dropdown and choose \"Studio Flow\". Then choose your newly created Flow and click the \"Save\" button.\r\n\r\n![Configure Twilio phone number for Studio Flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813646/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/twilio-configure-phone-number-for-studio-flow_wpoozx.webp)\r\n\r\n## Creating a Pipedream Workflow\r\n\r\nBefore we can configure the Deepgram add-on for Twilio, we need to create a Pipedream workflow that will handle the webhook from Twilio. Create a new workflow by clicking on the \"New Workflow\" button in the top right corner of the Pipedream dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Triggering the Workflow\r\n\r\nOur trigger will be a webhook from Twilio, so choose \"HTTP / Webhook\" from the list of triggers. Then choose \"HTTP Requests with a Body\" from the list of options.\r\n\r\n![Pipedream new webhook trigger dialog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813645/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/pipedream-new-webhook-trigger_gyge7b.webp)Finally, press the \"Save and continue\" button. This will add the trigger to the workflow and display a webhook URL. Copy this URL and we'll return to our Twilio Console to enable the Deepgram add-on.\r\n\r\n![Pipedream new webhook trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813645/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/pipedream-new-webhook-trigger.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Enabling the Deepgram Addon for Twilio\r\n\r\nBack in the Twilio Console, click on the \"Add-ons\" link in the left sidebar. There are two Deepgram transcription add-ons; \"Deepgram Base Transcription\" and \"Deepgram Enhanced Transcription\". Let's enable the \"Deepgram Enhanced Transcription\" add-on by clicking on it and pressing the \"Install\" button.\r\n\r\nOn the \"Configure\" tab, make the following configurations:\r\n\r\n- Ensure the \"Unique Name\" is `deepgram_enhanced_transcription`\r\n- Check each option under \"Use In\"\r\n- Paste the webhook URL from Pipedream into the \"Callback URL\" field\r\n- Choose \"POST\" from the \"Callback Request Method\" dropdown\r\n\r\nFinally, click the \"Save\" button. Your configuration should look like this:\r\n\r\n![Twilio Deepgram Enhanced Transcription Add-on configuration](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813646/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/twilio-deepgram-enhanced-add-on-configuration_p2g3kr.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Testing the Webhook Trigger\r\n\r\nWe can't continue building out our Pipedream workflow until we know what type of data we'll receive from Twilio. Place a call to your Twilio phone number and leave a message. Then open the Pipedream workflow. You should see a new event in the \"Results\" section of the webhook trigger. Click on the event to view the data.\r\n\r\n![Pipedream new webhook received](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813645/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/pipedream-new-webhook-received_dt6ggq.webp)\r\n\r\n### Parsing the Webhook Payload\r\n\r\nThe `event` property of the webhook has an `AddOns` property that contains metadata about any Twilio Add-Ons that were executed, including our `deepgram_enhanced_transcription` add-on. However, that property is a string containing JSON data. We'll need to parse that string into a JavaScript object so we can access it.\r\n\r\nAdd a new step to the workflow and choose \"Node\" from the list of actions. Then choose the \"Run Node code\" option. This will add a new step to the workflow and display a code editor. Replace the code in the editor with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default defineComponent({\r\n  async run({ steps, $ }) {\r\n    const addOnData = JSON.parse(steps.trigger.event.AddOns)\r\n    return addOnData\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code will parse the `AddOns` property of the webhook payload and return the resulting JavaScript object. Click the \"Test\" button to save the step. At this point, your workflow should look like this:\r\n\r\n![Pipedream new Node step](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813645/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/pipedream-new-node-step_jisayn.webp)\r\n\r\n### Requesting the Transcription Data\r\n\r\nWith our webhook payload parsed into a JavaScript object, we can see that Twilio doesn't send back our transcription with the webhook. Instead, it provides a URL where we can request the transcription data. Let's add a new step to our workflow that will request the transcription data from Twilio.\r\n\r\nClick on the \"Add a step\" button and choose \"Send any HTTP Request\" from the list of actions. Then choose \"Make an HTTP Request\" from the list of options. This will add a new step to the workflow and display a form for configuring the HTTP request.\r\n\r\nThis will be a \"GET\" request. The URL will come from the previous step so we'll need to add some Pipedream magic to get data from a previous step. In the request URL field, enter `{{steps.node.$return_value.results.deepgram_enhanced_transcription.payload[0].url}}`. This will use the Pipedream `$return_value` magic variable to get the return value of the previous step and then access the `url` property of the `deepgram_enhanced_transcription` add-on.\r\n\r\nRequests to the Twilio API must be authenticated. In the \"Authentication\" section, choose \"Basic Auth\" from the \"Authentication Type\" dropdown. Then enter your Twilio Account SID in the \"Username\" field and Auth Token in the \"Password\" field.\r\n\r\nThen press the \"Test\" button to save the step. After that request returns, you should see the Deepgram transcription results in the \"Results\" section of the step.\r\n\r\n![Pipedream HTTP request result](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813645/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/pipedream-web-request-result_xrviuu.webp)\r\n\r\n### Sending the Transcript as an Email\r\n\r\nNow that we have the transcript, we can email ourselves a copy. Add a new step to the workflow and choose \"Send Email\" from the list of actions. This will add a new step to the workflow and display a form for configuring the email.\r\n\r\nYou can choose whatever you'd like as the \"Subject\". I chose `Call Transcript - {{steps.trigger.context.ts}}`. This will use the Pipedream `context` magic variable to get the timestamp of the call.\r\n\r\nThe \"Body\" of the email will be the transcript. Enter `{{steps.custom_request.$return_value.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript}}` in the \"Body\" field. This will use the Pipedream `$return_value` magic variable to get the return value of the previous step and then access the `transcript` property.\r\n\r\nPress the \"Test\" button to save the step. You should receive an email to the email address associated with your Pipedream account with the transcript included.\r\n\r\n![Email of the transcribed voicemail](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/w_auto,c_scale/v1668813646/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream/transcript-email_iubwmd.webp)\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we built a workflow that will transcribe voicemails and email them to us. We used Twilio to receive the voicemail, Deepgram to transcribe it, and Pipedream to send the email. It's always fun mashing up APIs to create new functionality. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and found it useful.","src/content/blog/email-phone-call-transcripts-with-twilio-studio-and-pipedream.md","d4e0be0a75ad8a50",{"html":661,"metadata":662},"\u003Cp>Full disclosure: I never check my voicemail. I assume if what you need is pressing enough you’ll call back or send me a text message. But maybe there are times I’d want to know who called and what they needed. In that case, I need to receive that information in one of the channels I normally check, like email.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I built a workflow that allows people to call and leave me a message that will automatically be transcribed and emailed to me.

Pipedream is a low-code integration platform that allows you to build workflows that connect to hundreds of third-party APIs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pipedream will make a request to the Twilio API to get the actual transcription, format it, and send it to my email address.

Having read about Azure Key Vault, I knew that it held all the answers (or secrets.)\r\n\r\nSome quick Google-Fu later and my Node.js apps running in App Services were accessing environment variables with `process.env.{secret}`. Using this newfound knowledge, and to no avail, I tried to give the same access to my Azure Functions running in App Services.\r\n\r\nAfter much web (and soul) searching, I found the solution and would love to share it for the benefit of future generations.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n### Azure Key Vault\r\n\r\nThe Azure Key Vault supplies a way to store keys and secrets outside of the context of an application. Using access policies, you can allow your applications to access and/or manage the keys within the vault. You can include any secrets, from API keys to connection strings, in your vault.\r\n\r\n### Accessing Secrets as Environment Variables\r\n\r\nTo access Key Vault secrets as environment variables in your Azure App Service, you will need to setup an Access Policy.\r\n\r\n![Identity blade of Azure app service in portal](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137022/blog/environment-variables-in-azure-functions-with-key-vault/69500724-393e0980-0ec3-11ea-8ac5-c859956c3a12_tylwgx.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo do this, go to the Identity menu option in your App Service and access the \"System assigned\" tab.\r\n\r\nSet the \"Status\" control to \"On\" and press Save. This will register your app service with the Azure Active Directory. Now you can create an access policy for your App Service in the Key Vault.\r\n\r\n![Azure Key Vault's Access Policies blade](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137022/blog/environment-variables-in-azure-functions-with-key-vault/69500821-2ed03f80-0ec4-11ea-959c-94e540cfa40f_qlsmbm.jpg)\r\n\r\nOpen your Key Vault and go to the \"Access policies\" setting. Once there, click \"+ Add Access Policy.\"\r\n\r\nOn the add access policy page, set any permissions for keys, secrets and/or certificates. If you only want secrets added as environment variables, you can simply supply the \"Get\" permission for \"Secret permissions.\"\r\n\r\n![Add access policy window within Azure portal](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137022/blog/environment-variables-in-azure-functions-with-key-vault/69501029-82438d00-0ec6-11ea-825d-c346edc624d4_lynncg.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the \"Select principal\" option, search for your App Service's name and select it. Next, press the \"Add\" button to add the policy and then \"Save\" on the Access Policies page to commit the changes.\r\n\r\nYour App Service can now access your secrets as environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Wait!?! My Azure Function's App Service cannot see the Environment Variables\r\n\r\nCorrect. Welcome to the dilemma this post is destined to solve.\r\n\r\nThe steps above are needed, but there are a few more steps to access your key vault secrets within Azure Function App Services.\r\n\r\nFirst, decide what specific secrets you want your Function App Service to access. Then, find that secret in your key vault and copy its Secret Identifier. It will look like: `https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/MYVARIABLE/SECRETKEYHERE`.\r\n\r\n### Configuring AppSettings to Access Key Vault Secrets\r\n\r\nIn your Function App Service, click on \"Configuration\" and add a new application setting. Give it the name you want to access as an environment variable. In the \"value\" field, enter the following:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={SECRET IDENTIFIER URL FROM KEY VAULT})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, press \"OK\" and \"Save\" to commit the new setting.\r\n\r\nYou can now access that secret as an environment variable from within your Azure Function.\r\n\r\n### Wrap it up\r\n\r\nHopefully, this quick walk-through helps save you time in the future when trying to fight this battle yourself.","src/content/blog/environment-variables-in-azure-functions-with-key-vault.md","aa11e823d23f06a2",{"html":728,"metadata":729},"\u003Cp>While working on a project that used a mixture of Azure App Services and Functions, I needed to use environment variables.

I admit it. I have commitment issues. Well, at least when it comes to\r\ncover images on my Notion dashboards. I've tried to pick images that are\r\naesthetically appealing, but I tend to get bored looking at the same thing day\r\nafter day.\r\n\r\n## A Cry for Help\r\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm just starting my journey with Notion. I've dabbled\r\nwith it multiple times but it always seemed like just another \"note-taking\" app.\r\nThen I started seeing posts on Twitter from folks like\r\n[Kurt Kemple](https://twitter.com/theworstdev). It was clear that I was missing\r\nsomething. Every tweet or blog post I read made me realize I was fundamentally\r\nmisunderstanding what Notion is. So I put out a cry for help on Twitter.\r\n\r\n![Image of tweet I sent asking for Notion help](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651280565/blog/how-to-update-notion-cover-image-with-javascript/image-of-initial-tweet-for-notion-help.png)\r\n\r\nLuckily, Kurt came to my rescue and spent more than an hour showing me how he\r\nuses Notion to power his personal and professional life. To say it was\r\neye-opening would be an understatement. Weeks later, I'm still remembering\r\nthings he showed me and implementing them myself.\r\n\r\nOn top of all those databases and pages is a dashboard that I run my day from,\r\nbut I wanted a cool image across the top of the page. After realizing I'd never\r\nfind just the \"right\" picture, I remembered some of the things Kurt taught me,\r\nlike modifying things in Notion using JavaScript and\r\n[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/).\r\n\r\nNow that you know the why, let's get to the how-to.\r\n\r\n## What You'll Need\r\n\r\nIt could probably go without saying, but you'll need\r\n[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/)\r\naccounts. Once you've got those, you'll need a page that you want to change. Of\r\ncourse, you could do this for multiple pages, but for brevity, this tutorial\r\nwill show you how to do one.\r\n\r\n### Gather Notion Info\r\n\r\nNow that you've got a Notion account and have decided on a page to update, we'll\r\nneed to get the id of that page. If you're looking at the page in a browser, you\r\ncan get the id from the URL. If you're using the Notion app, you can right-click\r\non the page in the menu on the right and choose \"Copy link\". Then paste the link\r\nto see it.\r\n\r\n![Browser address bar showing a Notion Url](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651285538/blog/how-to-update-notion-cover-image-with-javascript/notion-app-context-menu.png)\r\n\r\nIn the URL, you want the alphanumeric string after your Notion workspace name.\r\nSometimes the URL has the page name pre-pended to the id. That's the case in the\r\nimage below (`Hello-World-5b1db5ba47e64a6b958c4a8a71f5677b`). You'll want to\r\nignore the page name and dashes in the URL. Removing that leaves the actual id\r\nof the page (`5b1db5ba47e64a6b958c4a8a71f5677b`).\r\n\r\n![Browser address bar showing a Notion Url](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651285413/blog/how-to-update-notion-cover-image-with-javascript/notion-browser-address-bar.png)\r\n\r\nNow that we have the Notion page id, we can move forward with setting up\r\nPipedream.\r\n\r\n## Connect your Notion and Pipedream Accounts\r\n\r\nTo access our Notion workspace from Pipedream, we need to connect our accounts.\r\nIn Pipedream, click on the \"Accounts\" menu option on the left. This will take\r\nyou to the Connected Accounts page, where you can click on the \"Connect an App\"\r\nbutton on the far right. You will then see the \"Select an App\" modal window. Now,\r\ntype \"Notion\" in the \"Search for an app...\" input and select Notion in the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n![Pipedream Select an App window](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651330319/blog/how-to-update-notion-cover-image-with-javascript/pipedream-connect-app.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll be asked to authenticate with Notion and allowed to choose which pages\r\nPipedream has access to. Be sure to allow access to the page you want to update.\r\n\r\n## Creating the Pipedream Workflow\r\n\r\nNow that Pipedream has access to our Notion account, we can create a workflow to\r\nmake changes there. Click on the \"Workflows\" menu option in the left sidebar.\r\nOnce the \"Workflows\" page has loaded, click the \"New +\" button on the far right.\r\n\r\n### Creating a Workflow Trigger\r\n\r\nAll Pipedream workflows start with a trigger. I chose to update my cover image\r\nevery day, so I chose the \"Schedule\" trigger. Pipedream has a nice process for\r\ntaking you through selecting what recurrence and schedule you want for the\r\ntrigger. In my case, I have it run at midnight in my timezone every night.\r\n\r\n![Pipedream workflow trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651333416/blog/how-to-update-notion-cover-image-with-javascript/pipedream-new-trigger.png)\r\n\r\n### Updating Your Notion Page\r\n\r\nWith a trigger in place, let's add a step to update our cover image. Clicking\r\nthe plus sign under your trigger allows you to add a step to your workflow.\r\nThere are a **LOT** of integrations, but you should search for \"notion\" and\r\nclick on the Notion option. Then you'll be presented with multiple options for\r\nintegration. You'll be calling the Notion API with JavaScript so select the \"Use\r\nany Notion API\" option.\r\n\r\n![Pipedream add step interface](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651344533/blog/how-to-update-notion-cover-image-with-javascript/pipedream-add-notion-step.png)\r\n\r\nThis will open the step editor. You'll want to select your Notion account in the\r\n\"Select a Notion account...\" drop down. Then it's time for the code. Pipedream\r\nadds some code here that retrieves your Notion user record as an example, but\r\nwe'll completely remove that.\r\n\r\nThen add the following code to the \"Code\" box. Be sure to update the\r\n`YOUR_NOTION_PAGE_ID` string with the Notion page id you identified above.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = defineComponent({\r\n  props: {\r\n    notion: {\r\n      type: 'app',\r\n      app: 'notion',\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  async run({ steps, $ }) {\r\n    try {\r\n      const pageId = 'YOUR_NOTION_PAGE_ID';\r\n\r\n      const data = {\r\n        cover: {\r\n          type: 'external',\r\n          external: {\r\n            url: `https://picsum.photos/1500/600?v=${Date.now()}`,\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      };\r\n\r\n      await require('@pipedreamhq/platform').axios(this, {\r\n        url: `https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/${pageId}`,\r\n        headers: {\r\n          Authorization: `Bearer ${this.notion.$auth.oauth_access_token}`,\r\n          'Notion-Version': `2021-08-16`,\r\n        },\r\n        method: 'PATCH',\r\n        data,\r\n      });\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      console.log(error);\r\n      throw error;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above updates the page to use an external url. That external url is a\r\nrandomly generated image served by [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/) with\r\nthe appropriate dimensions for a Notion cover image. Each night your workflow\r\nwill update the URL to a new image generated by picsum.\r\n\r\n## Turn it on\r\n\r\nNow that we have a trigger and a step to run, all that's left to do is press the\r\n\"Deploy\" button at the top right of the page. This will activate your workflow\r\nand schedule it to run whenever you specified. You can also click on the workflow\r\nand press the \"Run Now\" button to trigger it manually at any time.\r\n\r\nUpdating the cover image is pretty basic, but the principles learned can be\r\nused to **really** extend what you're doing in Notion. In future blog posts,\r\nI'll cover how I use Pipedream with Notion to create daily journals, follow up\r\nwith old colleagues and friends, and manage ideas for YouTube, Twitch, and blog\r\nideas.","src/content/blog/how-to-update-notion-cover-image-with-javascript.md","fb6f9a00effbbf08",{"html":799,"metadata":800},"\u003Cp>Okay.

As Deepgram CEO, Scott Stephenson, recently tweeted \"OpenAI + Deepgram is all good — rising tide lifts all boats.\" We're stoked to see others are buying into what we've been preaching for nearly a decade: end-to-end deep learning is the answer to speech-to-text.\r\n\r\nAs our team played with Whisper last week, we wanted to make sure as many people as possible could try it with minimal effort. And since we already offer some of the most accurate and performant speech recognition models in the world, why not add another? 😁\r\n\r\n## Announcing Whisper Multilingual AI Speech Recognition on Deepgram\r\n\r\nLast week, we released the Whisper speech recognition model via the Deepgram API. All accounts now have access to the whisper model for free. But, we wanted to make it even easier to try. So, we made it available for people without a Deepgram account. That's right! You can send files to the API without needing an API key. Try out the shell commands below to see how Whisper performs on your local files or those hosted elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Use cURL to Transcribe Local Files with Whisper\r\n\r\nYou can start testing the Whisper model now by running the snippet below in your terminal.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncurl \\\r\n --request POST \\\r\n --data-binary @youraudio.wav \\\r\n --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use cURL to Transcribe Remote Files with Whisper\r\n\r\nDon't have an audio file to test? You can also send the URL to a hosted file by changing your request to the code snippet below. You can replace the `https://static.deepgram.com/examples/epi.wav` URL with a file that you'd like to test against.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncurl \\\r\n  --request POST \\\r\n  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper' \\\r\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\r\n  --data '{\"url\":\"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/epi.wav\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe even provide several demo files that you can use:\r\n\r\n- https://static.deepgram.com/examples/dragons.wav\r\n- https://static.deepgram.com/examples/epi.wav\r\n- https://static.deepgram.com/examples/interview\\_speech-analytics.wav\r\n- https://static.deepgram.com/examples/koreanSampleFile.mp3\r\n- https://static.deepgram.com/examples/sofiavergaraspanish.clip.wav\r\n- https://static.deepgram.com/examples/timotheefrench.clip.wav\r\n\r\n## Try Whisper in Your Browser\r\n\r\nYou can also test the whisper model in your browser when you [signup for a free Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=demo&f-whisper=true). Our getting started missions allow you to compare the whisper model to Deepgram models using your own files and/or sample files that we provide.\r\n\r\n![Transcribe pre-recorded files mission in Deepgram console](https://res.cloudinary.com/deepgram/image/upload/v1664390668/blog/how-to-use-whisper-openais-speech-recognition-model-in-1-minute/192859735-e30b782e-b6d8-49b9-b05c-c79f8c168078_mweppn.png)\r\n\r\n## The Final Result\r\n\r\nBelow is the result of a NASA phone call transcribed with the whisper model.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"channels\": 1,\r\n    \"created\": \"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:25:08 GMT\",\r\n    \"duration\": 0,\r\n    \"model_info\": {\r\n      \"name\": \"whisper\",\r\n      \"tier\": \"other\",\r\n      \"version\": \"2022-09-22.0\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"models\": [\r\n      \"8024132e-81fb-4a77-9377-548cd12c143d\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"request_id\": \"826716cc-0c2d-4efe-b6e0-671ca5aea9d5\",\r\n    \"sha256\": \"unsupported\",\r\n    \"transaction_key\": \"deprecated\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"results\": {\r\n    \"channels\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"alternatives\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"confidence\": 0,\r\n            \"transcript\": \" Yeah, as much as it's worth celebrating the first spacewalk with an all female team, I think many of us are looking forward to it just being normal.

Sure! Where else can you get your hands on an implemented end-to-end deep-learning modern architecture to play with? As long as you don't need real-time transcription, whisper can be used for prototyping and experimenting. However, if you need real-time transcription, speed, and/or scalability, whisper is not ready for use today.\r\n\r\n## Testing the OpenAI Whisper Models\r\n\r\nHave you tried using any of the Whisper models since their release? Tell the community about your experience in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/30).","src/content/blog/how-to-use-whisper-openais-speech-recognition-model-in-1-minute.md","856bfd92133e2f05",{"html":849,"metadata":850},"\u003Cp>OpenAI’s newly released “Whisper” speech recognition model has been said to provide accurate transcriptions in multiple languages and even translate them to English. As Deepgram CEO, Scott Stephenson, recently tweeted “OpenAI + Deepgram is all good — rising tide lifts all boats.” We’re stoked to see others are buying into what we’ve been preaching for nearly a decade: end-to-end deep learning is the answer to speech-to-text.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As our team played with Whisper last week, we wanted to make sure as many people as possible could try it with minimal effort. And since we already offer some of the most accurate and performant speech recognition models in the world, why not add another? 😁\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"announcing-whisper-multilingual-ai-speech-recognition-on-deepgram\">Announcing Whisper Multilingual AI Speech Recognition on Deepgram\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Last week, we released the Whisper speech recognition model via the Deepgram API.

The community he had built was welcoming and supportive and his approach of pair-programming with viewers while injecting humor really resonated with me.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I had been developing with C# for nearly 20 years, and had been leading a team of developers for 10 of those, but had never taken the time to attend a meet-up or conference. This was my first step into a developer community outside of my workplace and I was hooked.\r\n\r\nI quickly became active in several technology Twitch streams and was sold on this medium for teaching and supporting developers. While I had supported and taught teams within my organization, I saw live-coding as a platform to positively impact even more people.\r\n\r\nSo finally, one afternoon in February, I pressed that small button with those now infamous words; \"Start Streaming.\"\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Lights! Camera! A-ha\r\n\r\nI'm thankful that Twitch doesn't retain streams indefinitely. Those first streams were rough; hours of talking to myself or a handful of silent viewers. Fortunately, many of the friends I had made in other streams joined me and were fully supportive.\r\n\r\nI spent those first few months doing what I knew: C# & Angular. I was working on client projects that I thought people would find interesting. I would stream for three to five hours and then watch the replay to see what I could do better.\r\n\r\nThen it dawned on me; I was starting each stream from a place of knowledge that viewers might not have. I had spent 20 years writing C# so there were things that I instinctively knew about the language, the tooling, or available libraries. While that knowledge helped me build solutions for my clients, it could alienate people new to software development; as I was expecting viewers to come in with that same (or a close) level of understanding.\r\n\r\n## Let's Learn Together\r\n\r\nDuring this time I was watching [Brian Clark](https://twitch.tv/clarkio) (aka Clarkio). He has a blurb that he goes through whenever someone follows his channel, but it always ends with \"sit back, relax and let's learn together.\" I've heard it said so often that it's permanently imprinted in my brain; so it's no surprise that it was the first thing I thought of when thinking of how to solve my problem.\r\n\r\nBased on that simple phrase, I decided to completely change the goal of my streams. I would no longer work on client projects and rarely use C# or Angular. Instead, I would spend each session doing something I didn't know how to do so we could literally \"learn together.\"\r\n\r\nThis shift made a tremendous difference. Viewers would teach me and vice-versa. Suddenly a new viewer could contribute and be apart of the project on their first visit and as an added bonus, I was learning new technologies.\r\n\r\n## Made For This\r\n\r\nWithin weeks, messages started coming in from viewers enjoying the change. As one viewer put it: \"makes something that would normally be dumbfounding look approachable.\" These messages completely altered my outlook. I began to realize that while I loved building software, it had never brought the sense of fulfillment that I found in helping others learn and succeed.\r\n\r\nThose messages, coupled with encouragement from others, caused me to realize that I was in the wrong line of work; so I started working towards a change to developer advocacy. After several months of resume building, giving talks at various meet-ups and conferences and help from friends, in October I became a Developer Advocate at [Vonage](https://vonage.com). I'd love to tell you more about that, but this post isn't about DevRel. I will say I've never been happier with my work.\r\n\r\n## Viewers. Friends. Family\r\n\r\nOne consequence I didn't foresee was relationships. One of the best examples of this came just before Christmas when a viewer arrived to say \"Hi all, I can't stay and watch. Wife and I are at the hospital and just had a baby. His name is Oscar.\"\r\n\r\nReflecting on the stream later I realized that so many of these viewers had sneakily become my friends. We weren't only talking about code, but about life. We were encouraging one another. When a stream didn't go live, I missed hanging out with my friends. When someone misses a few streams, I start wondering if they're okay. I admit this has been one of the best outcomes of the stream and I really do enjoy working with each one of them.\r\n\r\n## So Should I Stream My Code?\r\n\r\nNearly every week I hear \"I've been thinking of streaming my code, but I don't have X.\" My response is always the same; if you have a microphone, you can stream. Yes, ideally you'll have a webcam, but not all streamers show themselves and it's not required. Green screens, sound effects, etc., while nice, are not required. All you need is some type of streaming software ([OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or [StreamLabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs)), a microphone, and a willingness to share what you're developing/learning with others.\r\n\r\nLike blogging or presenting talks, streaming is simply another method to teach, help or encourage others. Any time you have the opportunity to do one of those things you should.\r\n\r\n## Start Streaming\r\n\r\nOf course, I should provide a warning. In the span of streaming for a year I have changed careers, gained a plethora of great friends and learned so much more than I have taught. You may be amazed by how your life is impacted by sowing into others. If you feel you can handle that, then it may be your turn to press that little button with those two innocent words; \"Start Streaming.\"","src/content/blog/live-coding-to-learn-share-and-encourage.md","ce2f4b329fa5a873",{"html":895,"metadata":896},"\u003Cp>“Start Streaming.” Two simple words.

My kids are doing amazing at\r\nschool and are active in music, theater, academic clubs, and cheer. I'm super\r\nfulfilled at work and am genuinely excited about the projects we're working on.\r\n\r\nBut in July, my mother passed away, two months after her cancer diagnosis. It\r\nwas so fast that she never got a chance to fight; no chemotherapy, radiation,\r\netc. I try to see that as a blessing. She didn't have to struggle.\r\n\r\n## A Year of Firsts\r\n\r\nI'm in the middle of a year of firsts; the first Thanksgiving/Christmas\r\nwithout her; the first birthdays without her; the first family vacation without\r\nher. Each milestone brings a tinge of pain as I realize how she would have loved\r\nto have been here.\r\n\r\nAs Mother's Day has approached (another first,) I've been reflecting on her\r\nlife. I feel very fortunate to be her son. She spent my whole life instilling\r\nwisdom, giving guidance, and providing support to many, but especially me.\r\n\r\n## Where It Began\r\n\r\n> **TRIGGER WARNING:** Physical & emotional abuse.\r\n>\r\n> Skip to [Hello World](#hello-world) below.\r\n\r\nMy mom had a very religious upbringing. The church she belonged to was very\r\nlegalistic. A \"no makeup\" and \"no jewelry\" type of place. But those things\r\ndidn't bother her. She loved it and even thrived. She loved people and serving\r\nthem. She met my father in church. His grandfather was the pastor. He was\r\ndetermined to be a minister and she loved the idea of being a minister's wife.\r\n\r\n![Mom and her mother](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651444382/blog/making-a-man-lessons-learned-from-my-single-mother/mom-as-a-girl.jpg)\r\n\r\nThough she had reservations about his character, they married soon after high\r\nschool. Then it was off to the ministry. Pastoring in various states, traveling\r\nas evangelists, and overseeing state youth ministries. From the outside, things\r\nlooked great. He was a great preacher and she was an amazing ministry partner.\r\nBut she was spending her nights crying herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhat people didn't see was the emotional and physical abuse she was enduring.\r\nIt's that same old story. He would abuse her and then apologize profusely.\r\n\"That will never happen again.\" But it always did.\r\n\r\nDuring one period, they had a small dog. My dad would yell and the dog would\r\ncower in fear. One night in a fit of rage, he picked up the dog and threw it\r\nagainst the wall. The dog died.\r\n\r\nThat's a red flag right!? But her upbringing taught her that divorce was the\r\nworst. In fact, you'd be kicked out of their denomination for it. So even after\r\nyears of abuse, and even a separation, she would reconcile and \"try to make it\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n## Hello World\r\n\r\nWhen I came along, my parents had settled back in their hometown. Dad was\r\nselling insurance and mom was a nurse. The physical abuse had stopped, but the\r\nemotional abuse was continuing.\r\n\r\nOne night, when I was three years old, I had done something to aggravate my dad.\r\n(I know. It's hard to imagine that I could _ever_ get on someone's nerves. 😁)\r\nHe was yelling at me and she saw me cower on the couch. It immediately reminded\r\nher of the small dog they had years earlier.\r\n\r\n![Me and mom circa 1981](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651444995/blog/making-a-man-lessons-learned-from-my-single-mother/mom-and-michael-toddler.jpg)\r\n\r\nThat was the straw that broke the camel's back. She immediately told him to\r\nleave and filed for divorce. Surprisingly, my dad made the divorce process very\r\neasy. He agreed that she could have everything except for a few pieces of\r\nfurniture and his clothes; the house, the car, all of it. `This should have\r\nbeen another red flag. 🚩`\r\n\r\nThe week after the divorce was signed, the car was repossessed. The mortgage\r\ncompany called to start foreclosure because the mortgage was three months\r\nbehind. People started showing up at the door requesting payment for work on the\r\nhouse that had never been paid.\r\n\r\n## You're Only Responsible for You\r\n\r\nMom often told me \"you aren't responsible for the words and actions of others.\r\nBut you are responsible for your response, and your words and actions.\" Looking\r\nback today, I realize she was teaching me that lesson with a lot more than her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n![Me and mom circa 1983](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651444686/blog/making-a-man-lessons-learned-from-my-single-mother/mom-and-michael-old.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhen everything seemed to be collapsing in on her, rather than admit defeat, she\r\nbuckled down and got a second job. She was working 4 ten-hour shifts at a\r\nhospital Monday through Thursday, then would work 3 twelve-hour shifts Friday\r\nthrough Sunday at a different hospital. **She was working two full-time jobs.\r\nOne as a cardiac ICU nurse.**\r\n\r\n> You aren't responsible for the words and actions of others. But you are\r\n> responsible for your response, and your words and actions.\r\n\r\nI'm proud to say that she lived in that same house until 10 years ago when she\r\nsold it. She paid back every single creditor. Once everyone had been paid, she\r\nleft the weekend job. But she didn't stop there.\r\n\r\nShe started taking night classes at college and, for a few years, I only saw her\r\non weekends and any weeknights she didn't have class. All until she graduated\r\nwith a bachelors degree in health administration. For me, they were hard years,\r\nbut looking back, her determination to succeed and provide for the both of us\r\nare all I remember.\r\n\r\n## Lead by Example\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger, I was a part of a Scouts-like organization. I loved it and\r\nbecame a leader early on. I remember one of the first camp-outs where I was\r\nresponsible for a \"patrol\" of 5 boys. One part of my responsibilities was\r\nassigning jobs around the campsite to each of my patrol members. Certain jobs\r\nwere \"cool,\" like fire duty. Others were the worst, like \"dishwashing.\" Each\r\nperson's job would change daily so everyone got to do it all.\r\n\r\nI remember being proud as I showed her my assignments before we left. I had\r\nranked all jobs from worst to best and scheduled myself for the jobs in that\r\norder. So Day 1, I was washing dishes and by the last day, I was taking care of\r\nthe fire. She was proud that I had taken to heart her words to \"never ask\r\nsomeone to do a job you aren't willing to do yourself. Lead by example.\"\r\n\r\n![Mom and my daughters](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651445143/blog/making-a-man-lessons-learned-from-my-single-mother/mom-and-the-girls.jpg)\r\n\r\nUntil my late teenage years, she was the Director of Nursing at various nursing\r\nhomes, managing hundreds of nurses. Here in Birmingham, even the hint of snow\r\nsends people into a frenzy. Roads are closed with the slightest freeze. So\r\nwhenever the roads were likely to close, she would load us up and drive to the\r\nnursing home. I'd spend my \"snow days\" on a nursing home unit filled with people\r\nfighting dementia and Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\n> Never ask someone to do a job you aren't willing to do yourself. Lead by\r\n> example.\r\n\r\nShe didn't necessarily _have_ to be there, but she wanted to set an example. If\r\nthe snow was bad and people were stuck at work, they would need to continue\r\ndoing their job (possibly 24/7) to take care of the patients. She wasn't about\r\nto ask anyone to do that without them seeing her at their side doing it as well.\r\n\r\n## Be a Man of Your Word\r\n\r\nUnlike my mom, my dad wasn't very reliable. I remember many times when I would fall\r\nasleep hanging over the back of our couch, looking down the street through the\r\nblinds, waiting for him to pick me up for the weekend. He never came. I could\r\nnever depend on anything he told me.\r\n\r\nOver the years, there were many times when I would be furious at him, but she\r\nnever allowed me to be disrespectful. In fact, while I was growing up, and\r\ndespite his verbal abuse of each of us, she never said an ill word about him.\r\n\r\n![Mom and Nathan](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651445263/blog/making-a-man-lessons-learned-from-my-single-mother/mom-and-nate.jpg)\r\n\r\nI'm sure it broke her heart to watch me be continually disappointed. But she\r\nwould simply stress the importance of keeping your word. Never at the moment,\r\nbut later, in a different context, she would say \"people with good intentions\r\ngive their word, but people with good character keep it.\"\r\n\r\n> People with good intentions give their word, but people with good character\r\n> keep it.\r\n\r\nLike the other lessons, it wasn't just something she said. It was something she\r\nlived. She made sure that I could always depend on her word. If she said she'd\r\ndo something or be somewhere, I could count on it. If she threatened punishment\r\nfor an action, she always followed through.\r\n\r\nIn all my years of baseball, band, award ceremonies, school trips, graduations,\r\nmy wedding, our kids' births, etc., my dad attended one football game. My mom\r\nwas there for all of it.\r\n\r\n## Show Love and Give Hope\r\n\r\nIn my pre-teen and early teenage years, I was super active in our local church.\r\nI worked in the children's department each Sunday and naturally the kids there\r\nwould look up to me and the other workers. Every once in a while, one of the\r\nkids would come up to me to chat and I'd often blow them off. I was very\r\ninsecure and worried I'd seem less \"cool\" by chatting it up with them.\r\n\r\nMom would always correct me later. \"You may be the only light someone sees\r\ntoday. Show them love and give them hope.\" She would always remind me that we\r\nnever know what is going on behind the scenes in people's lives.\r\n\r\n> You may be the only light someone sees today. Show them love and give them\r\n> hope.\r\n\r\nPeople who saw us likely never knew there were times when there was little more\r\nthan cereal to eat at home. They'd never know that I was afraid to answer the\r\nphone out of fear it might be my dad.\r\n\r\nIf I'm completely honest with myself, this has been the hardest lesson to\r\nmaster. Whether I'm feeling insecure or aggravated, I don't always show that\r\ngrace and kindness to everyone. But it's a goal I'm constantly striving toward\r\nbecause of the example my mother set.\r\n\r\n## The Farewell Tour\r\n\r\nIn her final weeks, we brought her home under hospice care. She was relatively\r\nalert, though, as time progressed, she couldn't communicate as well as she'd\r\nlike. In those weeks, she had what I call \"her farewell tour.\" The house stayed\r\nfull of friends, family, and old co-workers who came to see her and tell her how\r\nmuch she meant to them.\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed each and every visit and was always so happy when someone new walked\r\ninto her room. I'm happy she had that time, but I'm happier that I was there.\r\nMost of the stories I had never heard. Many of the people I had never met. There\r\nwere life-long friends. There were single moms who she had mentored or counseled\r\nover the years. So many more people were affected by her life than I could have\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n## Who was Elaine Jolley?\r\n\r\n![Mom](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1651445263/blog/making-a-man-lessons-learned-from-my-single-mother/mom.jpg)\r\n\r\nI've tried to encapsulate what my mom was like several times, but the best\r\ndescription of Elaine Jolley is found in the Bible. Galatians 5:22-23 describes\r\nwhat the world should see in people who are Christ-followers.\r\n\r\n> \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness,\r\n> goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing I could write or say to describe her better than those verses.\r\nEveryone was better for knowing her. The world was better with her in it.

While we've already successfully launched the system, I have a feeling others will want to use this same functionality in the future. So, without further ado, here are the steps we used in setting up each device to run in kiosk mode:\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Assumptions\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, we're going to assume you've got your application running at\r\n[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and deployed just fine.\r\n\r\nWe'll also be using the Pi's default OS of Raspian.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nFirst, let's install some prerequisites.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils unclutter\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Launch Chromium\r\n\r\nWe're going to launch Chromium after boot-up with the following settings:\r\n\r\n- Incognito mode (so it doesn't try to restart your last session after you inevitably kill the power)\r\n- Kiosk mode\r\n- Turn off pinch (so users can't zoom in/out)\r\n- Overscroll history navigation (to disable a user from scrolling left/right to go back/forward in the browser)\r\n\r\nTo do this we'll be editing the **autostart** file in **.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/**. So navigate to it with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen edit it with nano like so:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo nano autostart\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you’re in there, add this line to the end of the file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n@chromium-browser --kiosk --incognito --disable-pinch --overscroll-history-navigation=0 http://localhost:5000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis launches Chromium with the settings we mentioned above and directs it immediately to your site at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).\r\n\r\n## Turn off the Screen Saver and Hide the Cursor\r\n\r\nWhile you're still editing the **autostart** file, add the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n@xset s noblank\r\n@xset s off\r\n@xset -dpms\r\n@unclutter -idle 0.1 -roo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen save your changes and exit the **autostart** file.\r\n\r\n## Stay awake\r\n\r\nNow to keep your Pi from falling asleep we'll edit the **lightdm.conf** file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nModify the **xserver-command** line to read:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nxserver-command= X -s 0 -dpms\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen save and exit.\r\n\r\n## Disable Power Management on WiFi\r\n\r\nThe Pi's WiFi will also go to sleep if we don't change it. Modify it by editing the **rc.local** file with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the following line before _exit 0_ and save:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\niwconfig wlan0 power off\r\n```\r\n\r\n## You're in Business\r\n\r\nAll that's left is to reboot your Pi. Once it restarts you'll load directly to Chromium viewing your local application.\r\n\r\nIf you find any \"gotchas\" or improvements to the steps above be sure to leave a comment!","src/content/blog/setting-up-raspberry-pi-for-use-in-kiosk-mode-with-chromium.md","5312f4b25996caea",{"html":988,"metadata":989},"\u003Cp>Recently one of our clients approached us to develop an application that would run on a Raspberry Pi to use in kiosk’s throughout their facilities.

Of course, another common use case is\r\ndependency injection, where we inject an instance of a class to separate the\r\nconcerns of this class from others.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class AuthService\r\n{\r\n  private readonly UserRepository _users;\r\n\r\n  public AuthService(UserRepository repository)\r\n  {\r\n    _users = repository\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegardless of the use case, the pattern is the same and it's what we've been\r\nwriting in C# forever. But now primary constructors aim to simplify this code\r\nwhile also providing some interesting usage options.\r\n\r\n## How Primary Constructors Work\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at our `GeoPoint` class refactored to use primary\r\nconstructors in C# 12.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class GeoPoint(decimal latitude, decimal longitude) { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe constructor method has been removed and its parameters have been added to\r\nthe class declaration line. Already, you can see a reduction in lines of code,\r\nbut what really makes primary constructors powerful is that the parameters they\r\nspecify are in scope throughout the declaring type's entire body.\r\n\r\n### Parameter Scope\r\n\r\nIn this code snippet, we extend the `GeoPoint` to include expression-bodied\r\nmembers that return the hemisphere and meridian of the object. Notice the\r\nparameters are referenced like private properties of the class. That's because\r\nthey are essentially private properties. They aren't available publicly but can\r\nbe passed to base constructors, used to set properties, or even used in\r\nfunctions or expression-bodied members.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class GeoPoint(decimal latitude, decimal longitude)\r\n{\r\n  public Hemisphere => latitude >= 0 ? 'N' : 'S';\r\n  public Meridian => longitude >= 0 ? 'E' : 'W';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also means that our dependency-injected parameters look much cleaner as we\r\ndon't have to explicitly define private properties.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class AuthService(UserRepository users)\r\n{\r\n  public bool IsLoggedIn(string username)\r\n  {\r\n    var user = users.GetUser(username);\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Constructor Overloads\r\n\r\nOne thing you'll figure out quickly is once you've declared a primary\r\nconstructor, your class will no longer have an implicit parameterless\r\nconstructor. But fear not, you can always add constructor overloads with one\r\ncondition: they must call the primary constructor using the `this` keyword.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class GeoPoint(decimal latitude, decimal longitude)\r\n{\r\n  // Parameterless constructor with default values\r\n  public GeoPoint(): this(0, 0) { }\r\n\r\n  // Stay on the equator\r\n  public GeoPoint(decimal longitude): this(0, longitude) { }\r\n\r\n  public Hemisphere => latitude >= 0 ? 'N' : 'S';\r\n  public Meridian => longitude >= 0 ? 'E' : 'W';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Any additional constructors **must** call the primary constructor using the\r\n> `this` keyword.\r\n\r\n## Behavior of Note\r\n\r\nIf you're like me, you're already thinking about how you can refactor old code\r\nto make use of this cleaner syntax, but there are a couple things you need to\r\nkeep in mind before you start.\r\n\r\n### Naming Conflicts\r\n\r\nPrimary constructor parameter naming conflicts are allowed by the compiler with\r\nboth fields and properties. When it occurs, the property or field will hide the\r\nprimary constructor parameter. The only exception to that rule is property\r\ninitialization.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class GeoPoint(decimal latitude, decimal longitude)\r\n{\r\n  decimal latitude;\r\n\r\n  // Uses the primary constructor to initialize the property.\r\n  public decimal Latitude { get; set; } = latitude;\r\n\r\n  // Uses the field rather than the primary constructor.\r\n  public Hemisphere => latitude >= 0 ? 'N' : 'S';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Different Than Record Primary Constructors\r\n\r\nUnlike record types, public properties are not generated and because of this,\r\nthe `with` keyword cannot be used.

Maybe you were accessing a third-party GraphQL endpoint and now you're in a rush to get something out the door. One of your roadblocks? That endpoint doesn't provide CORS headers. No more calling it directly from your frontend JavaScript app.\r\n\r\nDo you need to create an Express app with routes for each data set you need? No way! In this tutorial, we will use the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apollo\u003C/a> client library within a Node.js Express app to provide a middleman to your third-party endpoint, without the need to rewrite your GraphQL queries and mutations.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn addition to Apollo, there are several NPM libraries, like \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lokka\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lokka\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">express-graphql\u003C/a>, that we could use to abstract our third-party endpoint. Each of these libraries have their pros and cons. We'll be using Apollo due to its popularity and the level of support it has as part of the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apollo Data Graph Platform\u003C/a>.\r\n\r\n> Want to skip to the end? You can find all the source code for this tutorial on \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/opentok-community/insights-api-samples/tree/master/nodejs-apollo-client\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub\u003C/a>.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nFirst, let's get all our files and dependencies in place. Create a folder called `nodejs-apollo-client` and open it in your terminal of choice.\r\n\r\nNow run `npm init` in your terminal to initialize NPM in the directory. Then execute the script below to install the dependencies.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install --save apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-client apollo-link-http express graphql graphql-tag node-fetch\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Build a GraphQL Middleman\r\n\r\nCreate a new file named `apollo.js`. This file contains the real \"meat\" of our solution. It brokers requests between our Express application and the third-party GraphQL endpoint.\r\n\r\nLet's start by copying the following snippet into that file.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst gql = require('graphql-tag')\r\nconst ApolloClient = require('apollo-client').ApolloClient\r\nconst fetch = require('node-fetch')\r\nconst createHttpLink = require('apollo-link-http').createHttpLink\r\nconst setContext = require('apollo-link-context').setContext\r\nconst InMemoryCache = require('apollo-cache-inmemory').InMemoryCache\r\n\r\nconst httpLink = createHttpLink({\r\n  uri: 'https://insights.opentok.com/graphql',\r\n  fetch: fetch,\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\r\n  link: httpLink,\r\n  cache: new InMemoryCache(),\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `client` object is an Apollo client. Because we're running this code on the server-side, `fetch` isn't available to us. So we'll start by creating an `HttpLink` manually so we can inject `node-fetch` in place of the built-in browser fetch.\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, we'll use the `InMemoryCache` object to handle caching data, but in your production solution, you'll likely want to replace this with whatever caching solution you prefer.\r\n\r\nNext, copy the snippet below into the `apollo.js` file.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst query = async (req, res) => {\r\n  if (!req.body || !req.body.query) {\r\n    res.sendStatus(500)\r\n    return\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const query = gql(req.body.query)\r\n  let variables = undefined\r\n  if (req.body.variables) {\r\n    variables = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(req.body.variables))\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    const result = await client.query({\r\n      query,\r\n      variables,\r\n    })\r\n    res.json(result)\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    console.log(err)\r\n    res.sendStatus(500).send(JSON.stringify(err))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mutate = async (req, res) => {\r\n  if (!req.body || !req.body.query) {\r\n    res.sendStatus(500)\r\n    return\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const query = gql(req.body.query)\r\n  let variables = undefined\r\n  if (req.body.variables) {\r\n    variables = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(req.body.variables))\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    const result = await client.mutate({\r\n      query,\r\n      variables,\r\n    })\r\n    res.json(result)\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    console.log(err)\r\n    res.sendStatus(500).send(JSON.stringify(err))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese functions (query and mutate) take a request, pull query/mutate and variable information from the body, and then forward those parameters using the `client` object.\r\n\r\nFinally, we create an `apollo` method and export it so we can use it in the Express workflow later. This function inspects the incoming request and forwards it to the appropriate (mutate or query) function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst apollo = async (req, res, next) => {\r\n  switch (req.method) {\r\n    case 'POST':\r\n    case 'PUT':\r\n      await mutate(req, res)\r\n      break\r\n\r\n    case 'GET':\r\n    default:\r\n      await query(req, res)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  next()\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = apollo\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Take the Express Lane\r\n\r\nNow that we've got our middleman built, let's plug it into an Express application. Create an `index.js` file and copy in the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst express = require(\"express\");\r\nconst app = express();\r\nconst port = 3000;\r\n\r\nconst apollo = require(\"./apollo\");\r\n\r\napp.use(express.json());\r\napp.use(apollo);\r\n\r\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis snippet will tell Express that you want to use JSON and insert our `apollo` function into the request life cycle. Essentially, every request to this Express application will now be processed by our middleman. So every GraphQL query and mutation will be forwarded on to the third-party endpoint and returned from your local server to your client of choice.\r\n\r\n## Handling Authentication\r\n\r\nThe example above can handle scenarios where you don't have to authenticate with the third-party endpoint, but what happens when we need to send custom headers with each request? As an example, let's use the Vonage Video \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/insights/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insights API\u003C/a> GraphQL endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe Insights API is a GraphQL API that allows you to explore your session metadata at the project and session level. It requires requests to include a custom header of `X-OPENTOK-AUTH` with a JWT.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll need a TokBox Account. If you don't have one already, \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokbox.com/account/user/signup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create one for free\u003C/a>.\r\n\r\nIn your TokBox Account, click the 'Projects' menu and 'Create New Project'. Then click the 'Create Custom Project' button. Give your new project a name and press the 'Create' button. You can leave the preferred codec as 'VP8'.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the 'project created' dialog within a TokBox account.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650137019/blog/using-apollo-to-query-graph-ql-from-node-js/tb-project-created.png)\r\n\r\nCopy the API Key and Secret on this screen. We'll use it later to configure our authentication.\r\n\r\n> For the full experience, you'll need data in your TokBox account. Take a few minutes to walk through the \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokbox.com/developer/quickstart/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hello World Quick Start\u003C/a> to build a real-time video application.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nCreate a new file called `config.js` and paste the code below in it. Be sure to replace the values of the constants with the API Key and Secret you copied previously.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Replace these values with those generated in your TokBox Account\r\nconst OPENTOK_API_KEY = ''\r\nconst OPENTOK_API_SECRET = ''\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = { OPENTOK_API_KEY, OPENTOK_API_SECRET }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Generating Custom Headers\r\n\r\nNow you'll want to generate a valid JWT to send in the header of each request. To do so, we'll need to add an NPM package. From your terminal install the `jsonwebtoken` package.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install --save jsonwebtoken\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, create a new file called `auth.js` and paste the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst JWT = require('jsonwebtoken')\r\nconst SECRETS = require('./config')\r\n\r\nvar now = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000)\r\nvar later = now + 120\r\nconst payload = {\r\n  iss: SECRETS.OPENTOK_API_KEY,\r\n  ist: 'project',\r\n  iat: now,\r\n  exp: later,\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst getHeaders = () => {\r\n  const token = JWT.sign(payload, SECRETS.OPENTOK_API_SECRET)\r\n  const headers = {\r\n    'X-OPENTOK-AUTH': token,\r\n  }\r\n  return headers\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = getHeaders\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code exports a method that will create our custom headers object with the necessary `X-OPENTOK-AUTH` parameter and attached JWT token.\r\n\r\n## Putting It All Together\r\n\r\nNow that we can generate headers appropriately, we'll need to update our `apollo.js` code to use them. Open the `apollo.js` file and add the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst getHeaders = require('./auth')\r\n\r\nconst authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {\r\n  const authHeaders = getHeaders()\r\n  // return the headers to the context so httpLink can read them\r\n  return {\r\n    headers: authHeaders,\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, replace the constructor for the `client` constant with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\r\n  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),\r\n  cache: new InMemoryCache(),\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Let's Run a Query\r\n\r\nWe can now start up the app in the terminal by running `node index.js`. Then we can send a GraphQL query to `http://localhost:3000`. Send the following query and variables to retrieve information about the sessions you created earlier.\r\n\r\n### Query\r\n\r\n```js\r\nquery ($PROJECT_ID: Int!, $START_TIME: Date!) {\r\n  project(projectId: $PROJECT_ID) {\r\n    projectData(\r\n    start: $START_TIME,\r\n    interval: AUTO,\r\n    sdkType: [JS, IOS, ANDROID],\r\n    groupBy: [SDK_TYPE]\r\n        ) {\r\n      resources {\r\n        sdkType\r\n        intervalStart\r\n        intervalEnd\r\n        usage {\r\n          streamedPublishedMinutes\r\n          streamedSubscribedMinutes\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"PROJECT_ID\": {OPENTOK API KEY},\r\n  \"START_TIME\": \"2020-01-01T08:00:00.000Z\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Be sure to replace the `{OPENTOK API KEY}` above with your actual API Key.\r\n\r\nYou should receive a result similar to below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"project\": {\r\n      \"projectData\": {\r\n        \"resources\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"sdkType\": \"JS\",\r\n            \"intervalStart\": \"2020-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\",\r\n            \"intervalEnd\": \"2020-02-29T08:00:00.000Z\",\r\n            \"usage\": {\r\n              \"streamedPublishedMinutes\": 898.6833333333332,\r\n              \"streamedSubscribedMinutes\": 1121.0166666666664,\r\n              \"__typename\": \"Usage\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"__typename\": \"Metric\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"sdkType\": \"JS\",\r\n            \"intervalStart\": \"2020-03-01T08:00:00.000Z\",\r\n            \"intervalEnd\": \"2020-03-08T08:00:00.000Z\",\r\n            \"usage\": {\r\n              \"streamedPublishedMinutes\": 97.11666666666667,\r\n              \"streamedSubscribedMinutes\": 12.766666666666666,\r\n              \"__typename\": \"Usage\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"__typename\": \"Metric\"\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"__typename\": \"ProjectData\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"__typename\": \"Project\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"loading\": false,\r\n  \"networkStatus\": 7,\r\n  \"stale\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out the \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://insights.opentok.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vonage Video API Explorer\u003C/a> (you'll need to be logged in to your TokBox account) to review the Insights API schema and learn about other data that is available to you.","src/content/blog/using-apollo-to-query-graph-ql-from-node-js.md","88dedea1135fbb27",{"html":1081,"metadata":1082},"\u003Cp>It’s a common scenario—you built a quick prototype, it worked great, and now management wants it live yesterday.

This post shows how to use the new implementation.","[AutoMapper] is well known in the .NET community. It bills itself as \"a simple little library built\r\nto solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that maps one object to another,\"\r\nand it does the job nicely.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I've used it exclusively with ASP.NET APIs. However, the method for utilizing it via\r\ndependency injection has changed. So let's review how to get started, how to define mappings and\r\nhow to inject our mappings into ASP.NET Core APIs.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nLike most .NET libraries, we can install the `AutoMapper` package from Nuget.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInstall-Package AutoMapper\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, we'll focus on two classes that are related; `User` and `UserDTO`.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\npublic class User\r\n{\r\n    public Guid Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string Name { get; set; }\r\n    public string FavoriteFood { get; set; }\r\n    public DateTime BirthDate { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class UserDTO\r\n{\r\n    public Guid Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string Name { get; set; }\r\n    public int BirthYear { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese classes will serve as source and destination types that we can work with.\r\n\r\n## Default Mappings\r\n\r\nWithout specific configuration, AutoMapper will match properties based on their name.\r\nBy default, it will ignore null reference exceptions when mapping source and destination\r\ntypes. Below is a snippet mapping the source and destination types using the default\r\nconfiguration.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\nvar config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg => cfg.CreateMap\u003CUser, UserDTO>());\r\n\r\nvar user = new User()\r\n{\r\n    Id = Guid.NewGuid(),\r\n    Name = \"Joe Bruiser\",\r\n    FavoriteFood = \"Curry\",\r\n    BirthDate = new DateTime(2000, 10, 12)\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar mapper = config.CreateMapper();\r\nUserDTO userDTO = mapper.Map\u003CUserDTO>(user);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will create a `UserDTO` object with an `Id` and `Name` that matches the original\r\n`user` object, but no error is thrown as a result of not having the `FavoriteFood` property\r\non the `UserDTO` type. Also, the `BirthYear` property of the `UserDTO` will be zero.\r\n\r\n## Custom Mappings\r\n\r\nWe can use projection to translate properties as they are mapped. For instance, the code snippet\r\nbelow shows how we can map the `BirthDate` property of the `User` type to the `BirthYear`\r\nproperty of the `UserDTO` type.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\nvar config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg =>\r\n    cfg.CreateMap\u003CUser, UserDTO>()\r\n        .ForMember(dest => dest.BirthYear,\r\n                   opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.BirthDate.Year));\r\n\r\nvar user = new User()\r\n{\r\n    Id = Guid.NewGuid(),\r\n    Name = \"Joe Bruiser\",\r\n    FavoriteFood = \"Curry\",\r\n    BirthDate = new DateTime(2000, 10, 12)\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar mapper = config.CreateMapper();\r\nUserDTO userDTO = mapper.Map\u003CUserDTO>(user);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting `userDTO` object will be similar to our first example, but this time it will  \r\ninclude the `BirthYear` property of 2000.\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n\r\nA clean way to organize and maintain our mapping configurations is with profiles. Many\r\ntimes these `Profile` classes will encapsulate business areas (e.g. Ordering, Shipping). To\r\nstart, we'll create a class that inherits from `Profile` and put the configuration in the\r\nconstructor.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class UserManagementProfile : Profile\r\n{\r\n    public UserManagementProfile()\r\n    {\r\n        CreateMap\u003CUser, UserDTO>()\r\n            .ForMember(dest => dest.BirthYear,\r\n            opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.BirthDate.Year));\r\n\r\n        // Configurations for other classes in this business\r\n        // area can be included here as well, like below:\r\n\r\n        // CreateMap\u003CRole, RoleDTO>();\r\n        // CreateMap\u003CPermission, PermissionDTO>();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor added isolation, we can create a project just for our `Profile` configurations. Using\r\nprofiles helps us keep configurations more manageable as our application grows.\r\n\r\n## Dependency Injection\r\n\r\nDependency injection is baked into ASP.NET Core, but to use AutoMapper with it we'll need\r\nadditional configuration and an additional Nuget package.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInstall-Package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Register AutoMapper\r\n\r\nOnce installed, we can define the configuration using profiles. In the `Startup.ConfigureServices`\r\nmethod, we can use the `AddAutoMapper` extension method on the `IServiceCollection` object as\r\nshown below:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// By Marker\r\nservices.AddAutoMapper(typeof(ProfileTypeFromAssembly1) /*, ...*/);\r\n\r\n// or by Assembly\r\nservices.AddAutoMapper(profileAssembly1, profileAssembly2 /*, ...*/);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Inject AutoMapper\r\n\r\nWith AutoMapper registered and its configurations set, we can now inject an `IMapper` into\r\nour controllers.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\npublic class UsersController\r\n{\r\n    private readonly IMapper _mapper;\r\n\r\n    public UsersController(IMapper mapper) => _mapper = mapper;\r\n\r\n    // use _mapper.Map\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the `IMapper` we can map our objects to their DTO equivalents using the `.Map`\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n## Wrap It Up\r\n\r\nNow that ASP.NET Core is injecting AutoMapper to our controllers, we can add configurations\r\nto our profiles or create new profiles for new business areas and still map appropriately\r\nwithout further configuration.\r\n\r\nOf course, we didn't cover all of the features of AutoMapper so I'd suggest checking out their documentation for more information about their capabilities. Hopefully this post gave you\r\nenough information to start trying AutoMapper yourself. Let me know how you\r\nuse AutoMapper in your applications.\r\n\r\n[automapper]: https://automapper.org/","src/content/blog/using-auto-mapper-with-asp-net-core-3.md","3f3feed2a1c35029",{"html":1134,"metadata":1135},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://automapper.org/\">AutoMapper\u003C/a> is well known in the .NET community.

So I decided to see if I could use a serverless function to do it for me.","Personalized short URLs look so cool. Sure, I could use a service like Bitly.\r\nThey even provide the ability to use your domain. But I love building things,\r\neven when I don't need to. It allows me to explore and learn new things.\r\n\r\nI realized I needed a short URL when I started sharing posts from my website,\r\nbaldbeardedbuilder.com. It's a long one, and that's not considering slugs. So I\r\nwent on the hunt for something super short and found bbb.dev. It's\r\nperfect! I purchased it quickly and got to work.\r\n\r\n## Storing URLs\r\n\r\nFirst up was keeping up with the short/long URL pairs. I knew I'd be looking for\r\na database, and having used [Fauna](https://fauna.com) in the past, I decided it\r\nwould work well for this application. My site doesn't get a lot of traffic, so I\r\nexpected their free tier to cover me.\r\n\r\n> **Update:** this function has been running for well over a year and I still don't\r\n> come close to fully utilizing Fauna's free tier.\r\n\r\n### Data Structure\r\n\r\nIn my Fauna account, I created a new database named `smolify` with a collection\r\nnamed `ShortyMcShortLink`. Why those names? Because I like to think my dad-joke\r\nbrain is clever. 😁\r\n\r\nNext, I added an initial record. I knew it needed a short code and a full URL,\r\nbut I also thought it would be cool to track how many visits that short URL had\r\nbeen used. So I added a `visits` property to keep track of that. My first short\r\nURL would be used for the BBB community code of conduct and looked like the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"source\": \"coc\",\r\n  \"target\": \"https://baldbeardedbuilder.com/code-of-conduct/\",\r\n  \"visits\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever I need a new short URL, I log into Fauna and create a new document in\r\nthat format with the corresponding `source` and `target`.\r\n\r\n### Retrieving Data\r\n\r\nWith data in my collection, I needed a way to grab specific records based on\r\nthe `source` property. To do that, I created an index named\r\n`shortyMcShortLinkBySource`. Again, I apologize for my dad-joke-inspired naming\r\nconventions. 🙄\r\n\r\nThat index has one 'term' that it watches; the `source` property.\r\n\r\n## Creating the Netlify Function\r\n\r\nOnce the database was ready, I moved to create a serverless function to\r\nretrieve and update data. My site is currently hosted on\r\n[Netlify](https://netlify.com), so their functions seemed like a great place to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nI created a new JavaScript file named `smolify.js` and added my dependencies.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Client, query } from 'faunadb'\r\nrequire('dotenv').config()\r\n\r\nexports.handler = async (event) => {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Finding the Short Code\r\n\r\nFirst, I needed to find the short code and get the long URL. To do that, I\r\ncreated the `getLongUrl` function. It takes a path (in this case, the\r\nshort-code) and finds it in the index I previously set up.\r\n\r\nThe `mapResponse` function performs a little mapping to make it easier to\r\nidentify the `id` assigned by Fauna for later use and then return the record\r\nFauna found. If anything goes wrong it returns undefined.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst getLongUrl = async (path) => {\r\n  try {\r\n    const response = await client.query(\r\n      query.Map(\r\n        query.Paginate(\r\n          query.Match(query.Index('shortyMcShortLinkBySource'), path)\r\n        ),\r\n        query.Lambda(\r\n          'ShortyMcShortLink',\r\n          query.Get(query.Var('ShortyMcShortLink'))\r\n        )\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    if (response.data && response.data.length > 0) {\r\n      const shortUrl = mapResponse(response.data[0])\r\n      return shortUrl\r\n    }\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    console.log(err)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return undefined\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction mapResponse(payload) {\r\n  return {\r\n    ...payload.data,\r\n    _id: payload.ref.value.id,\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Counting Visits\r\n\r\nBefore I send the result back to the browser, I want to record the visit to\r\nFauna. To do that, I created the `recordVisit` function below. It increments\r\nthe visit count that Fauna provided and then replaces that object based on the\r\nFauna `id` that we mapped.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst recordVisit = async (shortUrl) => {\r\n  try {\r\n    shortUrl.visits++\r\n\r\n    await client.query(\r\n      query.Replace(\r\n        query.Ref(query.Collection('ShortyMcShortLink'), shortUrl._id),\r\n        {\r\n          data: shortUrl,\r\n        }\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    console.log(err)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I updated the `getLongUrl` function to add a call to `recordVisit` between\r\nmapping and returning it.\r\n\r\n```js {2}\r\nconst shortUrl = mapResponse(response.data[0])\r\nawait recordVisit(shortUrl)\r\nreturn shortUrl\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Finishing Our Function\r\n\r\nWith the JavaScript ready, I added it to the handler function. First, it calls\r\nthe `getLongUrl` function with the `event.queryStringParameters.path`.\r\nI'll cover changing `/coc` to `/?path=coc` later.\r\n\r\nIf the function can find a short URL, the `redirectUrl` variable is set to its\r\n`target` property. If it returns undefined, the function will redirect the\r\nperson to the homepage of baldbeardedbuilder.com.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexports.handler = async (event, context) => {\r\n  const shortUrl = await getLongUrl(event.queryStringParameters.path)\r\n  const redirectUrl = shortUrl\r\n    ? shortUrl.target\r\n    : 'https://baldbeardedbuilder.com/'\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    statusCode: 302,\r\n    headers: {\r\n      location: redirectUrl,\r\n      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',\r\n    },\r\n    body: JSON.stringify({}),\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuring Netlify\r\n\r\nAll that was left was to redirect the traffic using the short URL to the\r\nfunction. Luckily, Netlify makes that a pretty quick process. First, I added the\r\ndomain to my Netlify application. Once it was set up and sending traffic to the\r\nsite, I set up the redirect on Netlify.\r\n\r\n### Redirecting the Short URL\r\n\r\nAt the root of the site, I added a `netlify.toml` file with the following\r\nsnippet:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n[[redirects]]\r\n  from = \"https://bbb.dev/*\"\r\n  to = \"/.netlify/functions/smolify?path=:splat\"\r\n  status = 301\r\n  force = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis takes all traffic to `https://bbb.dev` and redirects it to the `smolify`\r\nfunction. When redirecting, it adds the splat from the `from` filter as a\r\nquerystring parameter named `path`.\r\n\r\nRemember the `path` parameter I was grabbing in the function? This is where it's\r\ncoming from.\r\n\r\n## Wrap Up\r\n\r\nThen I deployed everything to the site. All traffic to the short URL is\r\nredirected to the Netlify function and I can add as many short codes as I need\r\nby adding a record to my Fauna database.","src/content/blog/using-netlify-functions-faunadb-for-short-urls.md","5673e732c3c572f0",{"html":1180,"metadata":1181},"\u003Cp>Personalized short URLs look so cool.

After joining, I wanted to ensure that my \"bubble\" included a diverse set of people. Here's how I did it.","This past year I've been examining the communities I'm a part of. It didn't take\r\nlong to notice that I was living in a bubble of people who look, act, and think\r\nlike me. It was one of those unconscious things, that when recognized, seems\r\nobvious and repulsive. I have always valued diversity on my teams and I want\r\nmy social connections to be equally diverse. That's why, when I was offered an\r\ninvite to join Polywork, I knew this was an opportunity to ensure my \"bubble\"\r\nwas diverse.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n## What is Polywork?\r\n\r\nBefore I get into what I did, let's talk about what Polywork is. First, I don't\r\nwork for or represent Polywork, so don't take my explanation as their \"official\r\ndescription.\" I see Polywork as a LinkedIn replacement that better represents\r\ntechnical and artistic communities. Whereas, LinkedIn focuses on what positions\r\nyou've held and education you've completed, Polywork focuses on what you've\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nPolywork recognizes that for many software developers, some of our most exciting\r\nprojects take place outside of the office. Things like blog posts, conference\r\n&amp; meetup talks, and YouTube/Twitch videos can all be highlighted on your\r\nprofile. You can also use Polywork to find other individuals who are open to\r\nmentoring you, speaking at your event, and more.\r\n\r\nThey also provide a \"follow\" feature which is similar to what you would be\r\naccustomed to on platforms like Twitter. This is where my journey to expanding\r\nmy bubble begins.\r\n\r\n## Polywork Follows: The !== Way\r\n\r\nWhenever I see content, regardless of platform, I always follow or subscribe to\r\nthe creator so I can see more content like that. I normally don't pay attention\r\nto who the person is, but I do notice what their role is, what company they work\r\nfor, etc. But there are so many white guys in the tech space, it's hard not to\r\nquickly fill up a \"following\" list of the same people. This is the first place\r\nI changed my habits.\r\n\r\nStep one in operation Expand The Bubble was realizing that I have an unconscious\r\ninclination to follow content created by white guys, here on referred to as\r\nWhite Guy Creators (WGC). Does that mean I stop following creators who look like\r\nme? Nope. Instead, I decided to counteract this disposition by following 3\r\nnon-WGCs for every one WGC. So if I see content I enjoy from a WGC, I give them a\r\nfollow/subscribe. Then I go on the hunt and don't leave the computer until I've\r\nidentified 3 non-WGCs that had interesting content.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the result? Gold. Absolute gold. There are a plethora of amazing\r\ncontent creators out there that are never recommended to me, or whose content\r\nnever reached my feed before. I don't know if this is due to the algorithms\r\nemployed by Twitter/Instagram/TikTok/etc, but by actively counter-balancing\r\nwho I follow, it appears I've broken through to this wonderland of amazing\r\ncontent that I had never seen before.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, I actually enjoy logging into the timeline to see what new,\r\namazing stuff I'll find.\r\n\r\n## Can You Hear Them Now?\r\n\r\nI'll admit, step two in my plans has been hampered. Soon after starting this\r\njourney, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Within 4 weeks of diagnosis,\r\nwe had spent 2 weeks in the hospital and now a week at home on hospice trying\r\nto make her comfortable as she becomes more confused and less the amazing woman\r\nwho raised me on her own. I only write this step because it was and still is in\r\nmy plans moving forward. If anything, it will help me stay accountable.\r\n\r\nBack to step two: Amplification. Now that I'm getting to see this awesome\r\ncontent by non-WGC, I want to make a conscious effort to break existing\r\nalgorithms and expose people who may follow me to these amazing creators.\r\nSo each time I see content that inspires, teaches, or encourages me, I want\r\nto share it with my community.\r\n\r\n## Break Out of Your Bubble\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to join Polywork, they've given me a VIP code for anyone reading\r\nwho'd like to get in on the action. Go to\r\n[https://polywork.com](https://polywork.com) and use the code `baldbeardbuild`.\r\nOnce you're in, I highly recommend using the steps above to expand your bubble\r\nand amplify the amazing content you find.\r\n\r\nHow do you actively combat your unconscious biases?

How can I pull that content into my Astro site so I don't have to duplicate it in content collections?","It started with a steno pad in 1998. It was my first \"office\" job, and I needed a\r\nway to keep track of my tasks. I built a process of writing down my tasks as\r\nthey came in, updating them as I worked on them, and crossing them off when they\r\nwere done. It was a great system that made me feel productive and in control.\r\n\r\nMy tasks were simpler then. They all had definitive steps and a clear end. Once\r\nI started working as an engineer, my tasks became more complex. While I had JIRA\r\ntickets, GitHub issues, and other tools to track my work, I still needed a way\r\nthat made sense to me and could include those tasks that weren't associated with\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nI found a good groove using OneNote for about 8 years but was never satisfied.\r\nAs I started to focus more on content creation & scheduling, I needed something\r\ndifferent. I went through a slew of tools like Notion & Obsidian, but nothing\r\nfelt right. Then a friend took an hour or so to show me their setup in Notion\r\nand the light finally clicked. I've been hooked ever since and now I manage\r\n**everything** in Notion.\r\n\r\nAs I was building a new version of my website, I knew I wanted to include my\r\ncontent schedule. All that data already existed in Notion, and I hoped to avoid\r\nduplicating it in an Astro content collection. So... I did what any\r\nlazy developer would do. I built a way to pull that data from Notion into my\r\nAstro site.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started with the Notion API\r\n\r\nI'm not going to focus on how to set up a Notion database and populate it. I'll\r\nassume you've already got that part done. The Notion API is documented well, but\r\nto give you a quick shortcut, you'll need an API \"integration token\" and the ID\r\nof your database.\r\n\r\n### Get a Notion Integration Token\r\n\r\nWithin the Notion app, click on the \"Settings & Members\" button in the top\r\nright corner. Then click on the \"Connections\" section under \"Workspace.\" On the\r\nconnections screen, click the link at the bottom that says \"Develop or manage\r\nintegrations\". This will take you to the integrations page.\r\n\r\nOn the \"My integrations\" page, click the \"+ New integration\" button. This will\r\nopen the \"Create a New Integration\" form. Choose the Notion workspace that\r\ncontains your database and give your integration a name. Then click the \"Submit\"\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\n![Notion Create a New Integration form](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto/blog/integrating-notion-with-astro-sites/create-notion-integration_ierd3a.png)\r\n\r\nOnce you've created your integration, you'll be taken to the \"Secrets\" tab of\r\nyour new integration. Press the \"Show\" button to reveal and copy your \"Internal\r\nIntegration Secret\". This is your integration token and you'll need it later to\r\nauthenticate with the Notion API.\r\n\r\n### Get the Notion Database ID\r\n\r\nGetting the ID of your Notion database is a little more involved. You'll need to\r\nopen the Notion app in your browser and navigate to the database you want to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n![Example URL of a Notion Database](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto/blog/integrating-notion-with-astro-sites/notion-database-url_fj7ex6.png)\r\n\r\nThe ID of the database is the first alphanumeric string after your Notion\r\nworkspace name (highlighted in the image above). Copy that ID and save it for\r\nthe next step.\r\n\r\n## Configuring Your Astro Project\r\n\r\nNow that we have our database ID and our integration token, we need to set up our\r\nproject. First, we'll install the Notion JavaScript SDK.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -D @notionhq/client\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the code snippet above, I install the SDK as a development dependency. This\r\nis because my site is built statically and I don't need the SDK in my production\r\nbuild. If you're building a server-side rendered site, you'll want to install\r\nit without that flag.\r\n\r\nNext, we'll need to create a `.env` file at the root of our project (if one\r\ndoesn't already exist.) Then add the following to the `.env` file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nNOTION_TOKEN = YOUR_NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN\r\nNOTION_DATABASE_ID = YOUR_NOTION_DATABASE_ID\r\n```\r\n\r\nAstro will pull these in auto-magically and we'll be able to use them in our\r\ncode later.\r\n\r\n## Connecting to the Notion API\r\n\r\nNow that our environment is set up, let's write some code. Remember that\r\nthis code is specific to my Notion database and schema so it will need to be\r\nmodified to fit the schema of your Notion database.\r\n\r\nWe'll start by creating a `notion.ts` file in the `src/scripts` directory. This\r\nfile will contain all the code we need to pull data from the Notion API and will\r\nbe referenced from any page or component that needs to use that data.\r\n\r\nTo start, copy the following into your `notion.ts` file:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Client } from \"@notionhq/client\";\r\n\r\nexport type ScheduledEvent = {\r\n  date: Date;\r\n  title: string;\r\n  description: string;\r\n  type: string;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport async function getEvents(): Promise\u003CScheduledEvent[]> {\r\n  return [];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first thing we do is import the `Client` class from the Notion SDK. Then we\r\ndefine a type that will represent our Notion data for the Astro site. In this\r\ncase, I'm using a `ScheduledEvent` type that contains a date, title,\r\ndescription, and type. If you're using TypeScript, you'll want to modify this\r\nto match the type definition of the object you'll be passing around your Astro\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nFinally, we define an async function called `getEvents` that returns a promise\r\nof an array of `ScheduledEvent` objects. This is the method we'll use throughout\r\nour app's pages &amp; components to pull data from Notion. Let's fill in the\r\nbody of that function next. Add the following within the `getEvents` function:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst notion = new Client({ auth: import.meta.env.NOTION_TOKEN });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a new instance of the Notion client and passes in the integration\r\ntoken we added to our `.env` file earlier.\r\n\r\n### Querying the Notion API\r\n\r\nNow we can query the Notion API to get our data. Add the following code to the\r\n`getEvents` function:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst pages = await notion.databases.query({\r\n  database_id: import.meta.env.NOTION_CONTENT_DATABASE_ID,\r\n  // Add a filter here.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis snippet will retrieve all the pages from our Notion database. However,\r\nit's unlikely that you'd want to pull back all records. Be sure to add a filter\r\nto narrow your request to just the pages you want. You can find out more about\r\nthe `filter` parameter of the `query` function in the\r\n[Notion API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query-filter).\r\n\r\nAs an example, the filter for my implementation is below:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfilter: {\r\n    and: [\r\n      {\r\n        property: 'Status',\r\n        status: {\r\n          equals: 'Staged',\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        or: [\r\n          {\r\n            property: 'Type',\r\n            select: {\r\n              equals: 'Long Form Video',\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            property: 'Type',\r\n            select: {\r\n              equals: 'Livestream',\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            property: 'Type',\r\n            select: {\r\n              equals: 'Short Form Video',\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            property: 'Type',\r\n            select: {\r\n              equals: 'Blog',\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        ],\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Transforming the Notion API Response\r\n\r\nThe response from the Notion API is a bit verbose, and by \"a bit\" I mean\r\n\"a lot\". We'll need to transform the response into something more manageable.\r\nBut like the filters above, this code will be very dependent on your Notion\r\nschema and the type definition you want to use in your Astro project.\r\n\r\nHere's the code I use to transform the response from the Notion API:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst events = pages.results\r\n  .map((page) => {\r\n    let type = \"\";\r\n    switch (page.properties.Type.select.name) {\r\n      case \"Long Form Video\":\r\n      case \"Short Form Video\":\r\n        type = \"YouTube\";\r\n        break;\r\n      case \"Livestream\":\r\n        type = \"Twitch\";\r\n        break;\r\n      case \"Blog\":\r\n        type = \"Blog\";\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n    return {\r\n      id: page.id,\r\n      title: page.properties.Name.title[0].plain_text,\r\n      description: page.properties.Description.rich_text[0].plain_text,\r\n      date: new Date(page.properties[\"Release Date\"].date.start),\r\n      type: type,\r\n    };\r\n  })\r\n  .sort((a, b) => a.date.getTime() - b.date.getTime())\r\n  .splice(0, 5);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case, I'm only ever going to want the next 5 events, so I use the `splice`\r\nfunction to limit the number of events returned. That may be different for your\r\nuse case.\r\n\r\nFinally, we return the array of events from the `getEvents` function making the\r\nfull function look like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport async function getEvents(): Promise\u003CScheduledEvent[]> {\r\n  const notion = new Client({ auth: import.meta.env.NOTION_TOKEN });\r\n  const pages = await notion.databases.query({\r\n    database_id: import.meta.env.NOTION_CONTENT_DATABASE_ID,\r\n    filter: {\r\n      and: [\r\n        {\r\n          property: \"Status\",\r\n          status: {\r\n            equals: \"📆 Staged\",\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          or: [\r\n            {\r\n              property: \"Type\",\r\n              select: {\r\n                equals: \"Long Form Video\",\r\n              },\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              property: \"Type\",\r\n              select: {\r\n                equals: \"Livestream\",\r\n              },\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              property: \"Type\",\r\n              select: {\r\n                equals: \"Short Form Video\",\r\n              },\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              property: \"Type\",\r\n              select: {\r\n                equals: \"Blog\",\r\n              },\r\n            },\r\n          ],\r\n        },\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const events = pages.results\r\n    .map((page) => {\r\n      let type = \"\";\r\n      switch (page.properties.Type.select.name) {\r\n        case \"Long Form Video\":\r\n        case \"Short Form Video\":\r\n          type = \"YouTube\";\r\n          break;\r\n        case \"Livestream\":\r\n          type = \"Twitch\";\r\n          break;\r\n        case \"Blog\":\r\n          type = \"Blog\";\r\n          break;\r\n      }\r\n      return {\r\n        id: page.id,\r\n        title: page.properties.Name.title[0].plain_text,\r\n        description: page.properties.Description.rich_text[0].plain_text,\r\n        date: new Date(page.properties[\"Release Date\"].date.start),\r\n        type: type,\r\n      };\r\n    })\r\n    .sort((a, b) => a.date.getTime() - b.date.getTime())\r\n    .splice(0, 5);\r\n\r\n  return events;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using Notion Data in Your Astro Component\r\n\r\nNow that we have our data, we can use it in a page or component. My use case\r\nlists upcoming events on my homepage, so I created a `Schedule.astro` component.\r\nThen I imported the `getEvents` function from the `notion.ts` file and wrote\r\nthe HTML to display it.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n---\r\nimport { getEvents } from 'src/scripts/notion';\r\nconst events = await getEvents();\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003Csection>\r\n  \u003Ch2>Schedule\u003C/h2>\r\n  \u003Cul>\r\n    {\r\n      events.map((event) => (\r\n        \u003Cli>\r\n          \u003Cstrong>{event.title}\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr/>\r\n          \u003Cdate>{event.date.toLocaleDateString()}\u003C/date>\r\n        \u003C/li>\r\n      ))\r\n    }\r\n  \u003C/ul>\r\n\u003C/section>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhether your use case is similar or not, the process is the same. Accessing your\r\nNotion data is fairly straightforward and can save you from duplicating content\r\nin your Astro project.","src/content/blog/integrating-notion-with-astro-sites.md","0d051e5091199c4a",{"html":1271,"metadata":1272},"\u003Cp>It started with a steno pad in 1998.

Specifically, let's talk about Azure. If you've got files to save in Azure, you're probably using Azure Storage. Azure Storage provides a number of great features at a very competitive price, but how can we access those files within a container running in an Azure App Service? Read on to learn.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n### Azure File Storage\r\n\r\n![Azure Add File Share window](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650124940/blog/using-azure-file-storage-as-container-volume-mounts-in-app-services/69987799-ef2dd700-1505-11ea-92bf-d93f604bfa8a_gvi1ya_ufkv0d.jpg)\r\n\r\nFirst, let's setup Azure File Storage. If you already have File Storage you'd like to use, then skip to the next section.\r\n\r\nFrom your Azure Portal, add a new Storage Account. In your Storage Account, click on the \"File shares\" blade. Then press the \"+ File Share\" button at the top. Choose a name for your file share and press \"Create.\"\r\n\r\n### Configuring Your Azure App Service\r\n\r\n![Azure App Service path mappings interface](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650124941/blog/using-azure-file-storage-as-container-volume-mounts-in-app-services/69988604-919a8a00-1507-11ea-802a-b9a7f0c03d53_vqnrgy_rr3l92.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe'll assume you already have an Azure App Service you're ready to configure.\r\n\r\nIn your App Service, click on the \"Configuration\" blade. Then click the \"Path mappings\" tab. Under path mappings you can click the \"+ New Azure Storage Mount\" option.\r\n\r\nLet's review the \"New Azure Storage Mount\" interface.\r\n\r\n![Azure New Storage Mount interface](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650124940/blog/using-azure-file-storage-as-container-volume-mounts-in-app-services/69988677-b8f15700-1507-11ea-8a4d-8f57a0e7dee3_q6v30k_neodqw.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Name** is important. This is the name you'll use to reference this mount later in your docker-compose.yml\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, we'll use the Basic **Configuration option**.\r\n\r\nChoose your existing **Storage Account** where your file share lives.\r\n\r\nFor **Storage Type**, select \"Azure Files\" and then select the file share you previously created as the **Storage container.**\r\n\r\n**Mount path** is the path within your file share that you'd like to mount. If you want to mount the entire file share, enter \"/\". Otherwise, specify the directory path you'd like to mount.\r\n\r\nFinally, press the \"Ok\" button to setup your storage mount.\r\n\r\n### Tell Docker About It\r\n\r\nOur final step is to configure our docker-compose.yml to tell our container how to use this storage mount as a volume.\r\n\r\nYou need to add a \"volumes\" property under the service needing the mount. The volumes property is a list in the following format: `{mount name provided above}:{path within the container}`.\r\n\r\nSo if you had a service named \"web\" and you had created a storage mount named \"data,\" your docker-compose.yml might look like the following:\r\n\r\n```docker\r\nversion: \"3.7\"\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n    web:\r\n        image: wordpress\r\n        container_name: web-wordpress\r\n        init: true\r\n        restart: always\r\n        ports:\r\n            - \"80:80\"\r\n        volumes:\r\n            - data:/var/www/html\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Wrap It Up\r\n\r\nAzure has made this a fairly straight-forward process, but finding this information was extremely painful. No Google-Fu produced the answers so I knew I needed to write this down to remember it next time.\r\n\r\nHave some feedback or questions?

That said, this isn't a post about why inclusive\r\nlanguage matters. There are plenty of resources out there to consume and\r\nlearn from. In this post, I want to share my experience in building a Discord\r\nbot using TypeScript, [Fauna](https://fauna.com), [Docker](https://docker.com),\r\nand [Azure](https://azure.com).\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n> Want to jump straight to the code, check out the [GitHub\r\n> repository](https://github.com/michaeljolley/discord-guy-bot). Want to add\r\n> the bot to your Discord? Visit [https://guybot.app](https://guybot.app).\r\n\r\n## What Should I Build?\r\n\r\nLearning to build a Discord bot has been on my to-do list for a while now,\r\nbut I hadn't really thought about _what_ I wanted it to do. Then I remembered\r\na project built by a friend of mine, [Luke Oliff](https://twitter.com/lukeocodes).\r\nLuke built a Slack bot that monitored messages for the word \"guys.\" It then\r\nsent an ephemeral message to the author alerting them to the opportunity to\r\nuse more inclusive language.\r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking. \"Wait... isn't that exactly what you said this\r\nDiscord bot was going to do?\" Well, my friend, yes. Yes, I completely\r\nplagiarized Lukes' idea. 😁\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nBefore I started, I decided on a few things I wanted it to do:\r\n\r\n- Monitor the Discord server 24/7 for \"guys\" in messages\r\n- Send a message to the author of the message with ideas for using more\r\n  inclusive language\r\n- Host a site where others could invite the bot to their Discord server\r\n- Deploy automatically when I push changes to the `main` branch\r\n\r\nI also wanted to make sure that the bot showed grace on the first offense. You\r\ncan only send ephemeral messages in Discord if the user is using an interaction.\r\nIn this case, they had only sent a message. So the only options were to reply\r\nin the channel they used or send them a direct message.\r\n\r\nIn order for the bot to seem more friendly, I decided to send the author a\r\ndirect message on the first offense so they wouldn't feel attacked or\r\n\"called out\" in front of everyone on the Discord server. However, subsequent\r\noffenses within 30 days would cause the bot to reply to the message in the\r\nchannel they had sent the message to and address them specifically.\r\n\r\nFinally, I decided that in both cases, I'd add a reaction to their message\r\nwith the GuyBot \"robot\" logo to denote to everyone that the bot was on the job.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nI knew I wanted to use TypeScript, so after a quick `npm init`, I installed\r\nthe following packages:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i discord.js dotenv express faunadb\r\nnpm i -D @types/express @types/ws copyfiles typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Technically, I installed other packages. Like prettier, eslint, and jest. But\r\n> those packages are irrelevant to the goals of this post and are only used\r\n> for making things pretty and tested.\r\n\r\nThe `src` directory will hold all my TypeScript code and it should be compiled\r\nto the `dist` directory. So I added a `tsconfig.json` file to the root of my\r\nproject with the following:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"es6\",\r\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\r\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist\",\r\n    \"rootDirs\": [\"./src\", \"./tests\"],\r\n    \"strict\": true,\r\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\r\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\", \"**/*.test.ts\"],\r\n  \"include\": [\"src\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setting up Fauna\r\n\r\nIf I want to respond differently based on the number of times a user has sent\r\n\"guys\" into a Discord server, I'm going to have to track those events. There are\r\nseveral ways I could have accomplished that, but I've really enjoyed using Fauna\r\nfor personal projects. They make it easy to get up and running quickly and I\r\nknow I've got the power of scale ready at a moment's notice. So I set up a\r\ndatabase in Fauna called \"guybot\".\r\n\r\n![UI for creating a database within Fauna](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348359/blog/building-a-discord-bot-to-improve-inclusive-language/fauna-create-db.png)\r\n\r\nWith the database ready, I thought through what my data should look like. I\r\nsettled on the structure below:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n \"user\": String, // The id of the user in Discord\r\n \"createdAt\": Number, // Will be the timestamp of the offending message\r\n \"guild\": String // The id of the Discord server. Discord calls these guilds so I kept their nomenclature\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause these records reflect every time the bot has notified a user of the\r\npotential to use more inclusive language, I decided to call these objects\r\n`Notices`. So I created a collection in my new database and named it `notices`.\r\n\r\n![UI for creating a collection within Fauna](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348359/blog/building-a-discord-bot-to-improve-inclusive-language/fauna-create-collection.png)\r\n\r\nI'll need to look up the history for each user when they send an offending\r\nmessage. In Fauna, indexes are perfect for data reads that include filters\r\nand need to be fast. I created one called `notices_by_user_guild` and\r\nspecified that it should be based on the `user` and `guild` properties.\r\n\r\n![UI for creating an index within Fauna](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1649348359/blog/building-a-discord-bot-to-improve-inclusive-language/fauna-create-index.png)\r\n\r\nNow that my database is ready &amp; waiting, it's time to write some code\r\nto utilize it. In my `src` directory, I created a new file called `fauna.ts`.\r\nMy plan is to keep all the data logic here and utilize it wherever I need it\r\nthroughout the application. I won't go through every line of code here because\r\nyou can always check out\r\n[the code](https://github.com/michaeljolley/discord-guy-bot) for yourself. But I\r\ndo want to point out the two methods that actually mean something:\r\n\r\n### getNoticesByUser\r\n\r\nThe `getNoticesByUser` function uses Fauna's FQL to call the index we created\r\nand return any notices sent to a specific user on a specific server.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nstatic async getNoticesByUser(user: String, guild: String): Promise\u003CNotice[] | undefined> {\r\n if (!this.client) {\r\n  return undefined\r\n }\r\n\r\n let notices: Notice[] | undefined\r\n try {\r\n  const response = await this.client.query\u003CFaunaResponse>(\r\n   query.Map(\r\n    query.Paginate(\r\n     query.Match(query.Index(\"notices_by_user_guild\"), user, guild)),\r\n    query.Lambda(\"notices\", query.Get((query.Var(\"notices\"))))\r\n   )\r\n  )\r\n  if (response.data && response.data.length > 0) {\r\n   const data = response.data as FaunaDocument[]\r\n   notices =  data.map(m => this.mapResponse(m))\r\n  }\r\n }\r\n catch (err) {\r\n  console.log(`Fauna:getNoticesByUser - ${err}`)\r\n }\r\n return notices\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### saveNotice\r\n\r\nThe `saveNotice` function saves the notice to Fauna. Nothing complicated here,\r\nbut I do use Fauna's FQL for this as well.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nstatic async saveNotice(notice: Notice): Promise\u003CNotice | undefined> {\r\n if (!this.client) {\r\n  return undefined\r\n }\r\n\r\n let savedNotice: Notice | undefined\r\n\r\n try {\r\n  const response = await this.client.query\u003CFaunaDocument>(\r\n   query.Create(query.Collection(\"notices\"), {\r\n    data: notice\r\n   })\r\n  )\r\n  savedNotice = this.mapResponse(response)\r\n }\r\n catch (err) {\r\n  console.log(`Fauna:saveNotice - ${err}`)\r\n }\r\n return savedNotice\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Abstract + Static\r\n\r\nOne thing that is probably good to point out is that `fauna.ts` file exports an\r\n`abstract class FaunaClient`. Each public method in that class is `static`. I\r\nchose that pattern so that later I could simply call\r\n`FaunaClient.saveNotice(notice)` without having to instantiate the FaunaClient\r\neverywhere I needed it.\r\n\r\n### Environment Variables\r\n\r\nFauna requires a secret to authenticate and Discord will need a token. To keep\r\nthose safe, I planned to add them as environment variables. So I created a\r\n`.env` file with `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `FAUNADB_SECRET`. My `.gitignore` file\r\nprevents them from being committed to GitHub and I'll add them to the\r\nenvironment when the bot is actually running in production.\r\n\r\n## Build-A-Bot\r\n\r\nThe logic of the Discord bot will live in a file called `bot.ts`. It will listen\r\nfor Discord to send messages to it and will review each message for any\r\nviolations. Currently, it looks for the use of the word \"guys\" within the first\r\nten words of a message. My thinking was that you'd address a group early in the\r\nmessage, but might use the word appropriately later. For instance, if you were\r\ntalking about the game \"Fall Guys.\"\r\n\r\n### handleViolation\r\n\r\nThe moneymaker of the entire bot is the `handleViolation` function. This\r\nfunction is called when we determine there is a potential to use more inclusive\r\nlanguage. It first checks to see how many times the author of the message has\r\nbeen notified in the current Discord server, but disregards anything older than\r\n30 days. _We err on the side of grace._\r\n\r\nIf the author hasn't had a notice in that time frame, we send them a direct\r\nmessage with the following wording:\r\n\r\n> Please bear in mind that the makeup of [discordServer] is very diverse, and\r\n> some people feel excluded by the use of the term “guys”. Maybe you could try\r\n> using _people_, _team_, _all_, _folks_, _everyone_, or _yall_? Thanks for\r\n> helping us make sure everyone feels welcome here.\r\n\r\nIf the author has been sent a notice within 30 days, we send the same message\r\nprefixed with their username. (i.e. @user, Please bear in ...) The difference\r\nis that for repeat offenders, we send the message in the same Discord channel\r\nthey sent their message. That means that everyone on the server sees that they\r\nwere addressed.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, a \"GuyBot Robot\" emote reaction is added to the offending\r\nmessage. That way all users of the Discord server can see that the GuyBot\r\nnotified the user of an opportunity to use more inclusive language.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nasync function handleViolation(message: Message): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\r\n  const discordServer = message.guild\r\n    ? `the ${message.guild.name} Discord server`\r\n    : 'this Discord'\r\n  const messageBody =\r\n    `Please bear in mind that the makeup of` +\r\n    discordServer` is very diverse, and some people feel excluded by the use of the term “guys”. Maybe you could try using _people_, _team_, _all_, _folks_, _everyone_, or _yall_? Thanks for helping us make sure everyone feels welcome here.`\r\n\r\n  let previousNotices = await FaunaClient.getNoticesByUser(\r\n    message.author.id,\r\n    message.guild?.id || ''\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  await message.react('guybot:879023217149358121')\r\n\r\n  // Show a little grace. If the person hasn't said guy in\r\n  // over a month, give them a little slack.\r\n  if (previousNotices) {\r\n    const lastMonth = new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 * 1)\r\n    previousNotices = previousNotices.filter(\r\n      (f) => f.createdAt >= lastMonth.getDate()\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // If a repeat offender, put them on blast in the channel\r\n  if (previousNotices && previousNotices.length > 0) {\r\n    await message.reply(messageBody)\r\n  }\r\n  // Send a DM to discreetly let them know about the servers expectations\r\n  else {\r\n    const dmChannel = await message.author.createDM()\r\n    dmChannel.send(messageBody)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  await FaunaClient.saveNotice({\r\n    user: message.author.id,\r\n    createdAt: Date.now(),\r\n    guild: message.guild?.id || '',\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### run\r\n\r\nTo start listening to Discord and reacting, we export a function called `run`.\r\nThis function connects to Discord and listens for any messages that are sent in\r\nDiscord servers it's been invited to. It checks every message and determines\r\nwhether to call the `handleViolation` function.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport async function run(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\r\n  try {\r\n    const client = new Client({ partials: ['USER', 'REACTION', 'MESSAGE'] })\r\n    FaunaClient.init()\r\n\r\n    client.once('ready', () => {\r\n      if (client.user) {\r\n        console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`)\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    client.on('message', async (message: Message) => {\r\n      const firstWords = message.cleanContent\r\n        .toLocaleLowerCase()\r\n        .split(' ')\r\n        .slice(0, 9)\r\n\r\n      if (firstWords.find((f) => f.includes('guys'))) {\r\n        await handleViolation(message)\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    await client.login(process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN)\r\n  } catch (error) {\r\n    console.log(error)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Allowing Others to Use the GuyBot\r\n\r\nOf course, I plan to use this bot in Discords I manage, but I want others to be\r\nable to do so as well. So I decided to build a small, one-page site that\r\nincludes a link to invite the bot to your Discord server. I didn't have time to\r\ndesign/build all of it myself, so I found a nice template on Envato and removed\r\n90% of it to just what I needed. All those assets I loaded into a `public`\r\ndirectory and then created an `index.js` to serve as my Express app to serve\r\nthe pages up.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv'\r\nimport { run } from './bot'\r\n\r\nimport Express from 'express'\r\nconst app = Express()\r\nconst port = 80\r\n\r\ndotenv.config()\r\n\r\nrun()\r\n\r\napp.use(Express.static('public'))\r\n\r\napp.listen(port, () => {\r\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port: ${port}`)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause that file is what will be executed on startup, I imported the `run`\r\nfunction we created earlier and do everything here. The bot will be started and\r\nExpress will start serving the contents of the `public` directory as soon as it\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n## Docker all the Things\r\n\r\nI love putting things in Docker containers. It's such a nice way to make sure my\r\ndevelopment and production environments are consistent. So I added a\r\n`Dockerfile` to the root of the project with the following:\r\n\r\n```docker\r\nFROM node:12.6.0-alpine as build\r\n\r\nARG BUILDVERSION=0.0.0\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Copy dependency files\r\nCOPY ./package.json ./\r\n\r\n# Clean install depdenencies\r\nRUN npm i --silent\r\n\r\n# Copy the rest of the files\r\nCOPY ./ .\r\n\r\n# Build the application\r\nRUN npm run build\r\n\r\n# Put together the release image with the just build artifacts\r\nFROM node:12.6.0-alpine\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Copy dependency files\r\nCOPY ./package.json ./\r\n\r\n# Clean install production-only dependencies\r\nRUN npm i --silent --only=production\r\n\r\n# Copy built project\r\nCOPY --from=build /app/dist ./\r\n\r\nEXPOSE 80\r\n\r\nCMD [ \"node\", \"index.js\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file creates a Node.js environment, installs all dependencies, and builds\r\nmy application. Then it creates a new container and copies the `dist` folder\r\nfrom the original. This way the final image only has the files needed to run the\r\napplication without the original source code.\r\n\r\nIt's probably important to note how I build the application. Since it's written\r\nin TypeScript, I need to compile it to JavaScript. Using `tsc` will do this for me,\r\nbut there are other important things to do. Below are the scripts from my\r\n`package.json` file. Notice the `build` command. I use the copyfiles package to\r\nmove the static content of the website to the `dist` directory. That way they\r\nwill be included in the copy to the final Docker image.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n \"build\": \"tsc && copyfiles -E -u 1 \\\"src/public/**/*\\\" dist\",\r\n \"format\": \"prettier --write **/*.ts\",\r\n \"format-check\": \"prettier --check **/*.ts\",\r\n \"lint\": \"eslint src/**/*.ts\",\r\n \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Continuous Deployments with GitHub &amp; Azure\r\n\r\nI love continuous deployments. It's not the consistent deployment process or\r\nthat they help ensure my code builds correctly before it goes to production. If\r\nI'm being honest, it's because I'm lazy. Anytime I can automate a task and not\r\ndo it myself, I'm all in. Luckily, GitHub Actions make building CD processes\r\nquick and painless.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, I'm running the Docker container in an Azure Web App that\r\nalready has the environment variables I need set up. I also have an Azure\r\nContainer Registry that hosts the Docker images the web app needs. So in my\r\nGitHub Action, I only need to build the Docker image and push it to my Azure\r\nContainer Registry.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nname: CD\r\n\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches: [main]\r\njobs:\r\n  deploy:\r\n    if: ${{ github.event.head_commit.committer.name != 'Versioning Action' }}\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n        with:\r\n          token: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\r\n      - uses: tool3/bump@master\r\n        id: bump\r\n        with:\r\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\r\n          user: 'Versioning Action'\r\n          email: 'versioning@github.com'\r\n          branch: 'main'\r\n      - uses: azure/docker-login@v1\r\n        with:\r\n          login-server: ${{ secrets.ACR_LOGIN }}\r\n          username: ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }}\r\n          password: ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}\r\n      - name: 'Push images to ACR'\r\n        run: |\r\n          echo \"${{ steps.bump.outputs.version }}\"\r\n          docker build . --tag ${{ secrets.ACR_LOGIN }}/guybot:${{ steps.bump.outputs.version }} --tag ${{ secrets.ACR_LOGIN }}/guybot:latest\r\n          docker push ${{ secrets.ACR_LOGIN }}/guybot:${{ steps.bump.outputs.version }}\r\n          docker push ${{ secrets.ACR_LOGIN }}/guybot:latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow any time I push new code to the `main` branch, the GitHub Action updates the\r\nversion number of my `package.json` and commits that back to the repository.\r\nThen it builds an image tagged with `latest` and the version number and pushes\r\nboth of them to Azure.\r\n\r\nThe Azure Web App is set to automatically pull changes to the `latest` image and\r\nredeploy itself.\r\n\r\n## Wrap Up\r\n\r\nThis was such a fun, and useful, project to start with. It certainly gave me\r\nsome exposure to building bots for Discord and has opened up some ideas that\r\nI'll attack in future projects.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to add the bot to your discord, visit\r\n[https://guybot.app](https://guybot.app) for an easy link to invite it to your\r\nserver.","src/content/blog/building-a-discord-bot-to-improve-inclusive-language.md","b58d0d55491a797c",{"html":1356,"metadata":1357},"\u003Cp>Growing up in the Southeast US, the word “guys” was used to denote everyone.\r\nSure we had other words that meant the same; y’all, folks, and everybody to\r\nname a few, but no one thought twice about calling to a group of people with\r\n“hey guys.” Heck, even though my immediate family includes my wife and two\r\ndaughters, I’ve found myself calling to my family with a “hey guys.” But I\r\ncan do better.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been working over the last year to be more intentional with the words I\r\nuse; understanding that they can and do affect others in ways that I hadn’t\r\nconsidered in the past.

(Hopefully you did a backup beforehand.)\r\n\r\nA few months ago, I experienced Winpocalypse 2019 and I’ve been very protective about what I re-install on my machine since. Applications that were commonplace have undergone intense scrutiny when deciding whether to re-install. One big target: SQL Server. Even express & developer editions are bloated and introduce attack vectors on my local machine.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\nFirst off, let me be clear, I did install SQL Management Studio (SSMS) early on. I use it frequently to access and monitor various databases. The question was, do I need a full database engine running locally and the answer is an emphatic NO.\r\nI always learn best when working through a real-world problem so let’s address how to live SQL installation free in 2019.\r\n\r\n### Real World Use Case\r\n\r\nWe have a development SQL database hosted in Azure for one of our clients. Occasionally they will send us a backup of the production database to restore over our copy to have more recent, clean data. The normal process would be to load that .BAK file to Azure storage and do a backup restore into SQL Azure. However, this backup contained a custom SQL login, which will prevent SQL Azure from restoring the backup.\r\n\r\nThe solution? Restore the backup locally, remove the login, create a new backup and restore again. But how to restore the backup without the SQL database engine installed?\r\n\r\n### Docker, Docker, Docker\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has released several Docker images for SQL Server, including one that runs on Linux. Since my Docker for Windows is configured for Linux containers that seemed like a great place to start. First, I needed to find an image I could pull. My Google-Fu turned up several options, but I decided on `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest`.\r\n\r\n#### Docker Run\r\n\r\nLet’s go through the command to get everything running and then detail what each parameter is for.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\ndocker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' `\r\n-e 'SA_PASSWORD=YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD' `\r\n-p 1433:1433 `\r\n-v YOUR_HOST_PATH:/var/opts/mssql/data `\r\n--name sql1 `\r\n-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will create and run a Docker container based on the latest SQL Server 2017 Linux container image. You could connect to the server running in this container via SSMS now. Just use 127.0.0.1,1433 with SA and your password. Any databases you create will be saved to the host path specified in the `-v` command.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re done with the container just delete it and clean up any images you don’t want. Just like that you’ve used SQL Server without installing it on your machine and have no residual muck that lives on post-uninstall.\r\n\r\n#### Get to the deets of the command\r\n\r\n#### -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y'\r\n\r\nThis flag just accepts the SQL Server EULA. Nothing to see here. Move along.\r\n\r\n#### -e 'SA_PASSWORD=YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD'\r\n\r\nOf course, you’ll want to replace `YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD` with an actual strong password, but this is just setting that initial password for the sa login.\r\n\r\n#### -p 1433:1433\r\n\r\nIn the format of `\u003CHost port>:\u003CContainer port>`, this maps the containers port to a specific port on the host. In my case, I mapped 1433 (SQL's default port) to the host 1433. I could have just as easily mapped it to something else (i.e. `-p 5050:1433`). The important thing here is that whatever port is used on the host side is the port I'll use in SSMS to connect. To use a port other than the default, enter the server address in SSMS as `127.0.0.1,\u003Cport you chose>`. Yeah, it's a comma. Don't ask. :)\r\n\r\n#### -v YOUR_HOST_PATH:/var/opts/mssql/data\r\n\r\nMaps a path on the host to a path in the container in the format of `{HOST PATH}:{CONTAINER PATH}`. In this instance, any databases created in the container will be accessible as mdf/ldf files on the host in that directory.\r\nYou could exclude this parameter and then use `docker cp` to copy files in & out of the container. However, it’s important to remember that if you have data stored in a container and destroy it, that data is lost.\r\n\r\n#### --name sql1\r\n\r\nAn easy to remember name for the container. If not specified, you’ll have to reference the container by its id.\r\n\r\n#### -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest\r\n\r\nSpecifies what image to build the container from.\r\n\r\n### Down With SQL Server, Long Live SQL Server\r\n\r\nWas that easy or what? Now that you can spin up an instance of SQL Server in a container and destroy it when you're done why would you ever manually install the SQL engine on your development machine? No really, let me know some use cases that might not be served by running SQL in a container.","src/content/blog/using-sql-server-in-docker-containers-for-basic-tasks.md","f553ef9cbcbf27d7",{"html":1420,"metadata":1421},"\u003Cp>If you’ve ever used a Windows machine you’ve probably experienced a Winpocalypse.

Then we'll display that sentiment as an emoji over their video.\r\n\r\n\u003C!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore getting started, you'll need a few things:\r\n\r\n- A TokBox Account — [create one for free](https://tokbox.com/account) if you haven't already\r\n- A free Azure Account with [Face API Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/)\r\n- Optional: [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for test deployment\r\n\r\n> Want to skip to the end? You can find all the source code for this tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/opentok-community/video-azure-sentiment).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nWe'll use JavaScript to do the heavy lifting, so let's get the HTML &amp; CSS out of the way.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir video-sentiment\r\ncd video-sentiment\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the root of the video-sentiment folder, create an `index.html` file and copy the following to it.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003C!DOCTYPE html>\r\n\u003Chtml>\r\n  \u003Chead>\r\n    \u003Ctitle>OpenTok Sentiment Analysis\u003C/title>\r\n\r\n    \u003Clink\r\n      href=\"https://emoji-css.afeld.me/emoji.css\"\r\n      rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n      type=\"text/css\"\r\n    />\r\n    \u003Clink href=\"css/app.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n\r\n    \u003Cscript src=\"https://static.opentok.com/v2/js/opentok.min.js\">\u003C/script>\r\n\r\n    \u003C!-- Polyfill for fetch API so that we can fetch the sessionId and token in IE11 -->\r\n    \u003Cscript\r\n      src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/promise-polyfill@7/dist/polyfill.min.js\"\r\n      charset=\"utf-8\"\r\n    >\u003C/script>\r\n    \u003Cscript\r\n      src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fetch/2.0.3/fetch.min.js\"\r\n      charset=\"utf-8\"\r\n    >\u003C/script>\r\n  \u003C/head>\r\n  \u003Cbody>\r\n    \u003Cdiv id=\"videos\">\r\n      \u003Cdiv id=\"subscriber\">\u003C/div>\r\n      \u003Cdiv id=\"publisher\">\u003C/div>\r\n    \u003C/div>\r\n\r\n    \u003C!-- Footer will go here -->\r\n\r\n    \u003Cscript type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/config.js\">\u003C/script>\r\n    \u003Cscript type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/app.js\">\u003C/script>\r\n  \u003C/body>\r\n\u003C/html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, create a `css` directory and add an `app.css` file to it. Copy the CSS below into that file.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody,\r\nhtml {\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  background-color: black;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n#videos {\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  height: 50%;\r\n  margin-left: auto;\r\n  margin-right: auto;\r\n}\r\n#subscriber {\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n#publisher {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  bottom: 50px;\r\n  right: 0px;\r\n  z-index: 100;\r\n}\r\n.OT_subscriber {\r\n  width: 300px !important;\r\n  height: 200px !important;\r\n  float: left;\r\n  margin: 5px !important;\r\n}\r\n.OT_widget-container {\r\n  padding: 6px 0 0 6px !important;\r\n  background-color: #70b7fd !important;\r\n}\r\n#publisher .OT_widget-container {\r\n  padding: 6px 0 0 6px !important;\r\n  background-color: hotpink !important;\r\n}\r\n.sentiment {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  z-index: 9000;\r\n  height: 100px;\r\n  width: 100px;\r\n  font-size: 48px;\r\n}\r\nfooter {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n  height: 30px;\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n  background-color: gray;\r\n}\r\nbutton {\r\n  font-size: 16px;\r\n  padding: 5px 10px;\r\n  display: inline;\r\n}\r\nul {\r\n  float: right;\r\n  display: inline;\r\n  list-style: none;\r\n  padding: 5px 10px;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\nli {\r\n  display: inline;\r\n  background-color: lightgrey;\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n  display: none;\r\n}\r\nli.used {\r\n  display: inline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Let's Get Configured\r\n\r\nGreat! Now we can make that pretty HTML &amp; CSS do something. Create a `js` folder and add a `config.js` file.\r\n\r\nThe `config.js` file contains configuration parameters that we'll get from our TokBox and Azure accounts. Copy the following into the `config.js` file.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Replace these values with those generated in your TokBox and Azure Accounts\r\nconst OPENTOK_API_KEY = ''\r\nconst OPENTOK_SESSION_ID = ''\r\nconst OPENTOK_TOKEN = ''\r\nconst AZURE_FACE_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = ''\r\nconst AZURE_FACE_API_ENDPOINT = ''\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OpenTok Settings\r\n\r\nWe'll get the `OPENTOK_API_KEY`, `OPENTOK_SESSION_ID` and `OPENTOK_TOKEN` variables from our TokBox Account.\r\n\r\nIn your TokBox Account, click the 'Projects' menu and 'Create New Project.' Then click the 'Create Custom Project' button. Give your new project a name and press the 'Create' button. You can leave the preferred codec as 'VP8'.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the 'project created' dialog within a TokBox account.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650129058/blog/sentiment-analysis-with-opentok-and-azure-face-api/tb-project-created.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then copy your API Key and paste it as the value for the `OPENTOK_API_KEY` setting.\r\nNext, click on \"View Project\". At the bottom of the project detail page, you'll find the Project Tools where you can create a Session ID and Token. Choose \"Routed\" for your session's media mode and press the \"Create Session ID\" button. Then, copy the generated Session ID and paste it as the value of the `OPENTOK_SESSION_ID` setting.\r\n\r\nFinally, paste the generated session ID into the Session ID field of the Generate Token form and press the \"Generate Token\" button. Copy the generated Token as the value of the `OPENTOK_TOKEN` setting.\r\n\r\n![Project Tools area of a specific project in a TokBox account.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650129058/blog/sentiment-analysis-with-opentok-and-azure-face-api/tb-project-tools.png)\r\n\r\n### Azure Face API Settings\r\n\r\nLog into your Azure account and create a new Face API Cognitive Service. Once created, click on the service and go to the \"Quick start\" blade. There you'll find your `Key` and `Endpoint`. Copy these two values to the `AZURE_FACE_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `AZURE_FACE_API_ENDPOINT` settings, respectively.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the Quick start blade within Azure for the Face API service.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650129058/blog/sentiment-analysis-with-opentok-and-azure-face-api/azure-face-quickstart.png)\r\n\r\n## I Feel Seen\r\n\r\nWith our configuration ready, let's add some JavaScript to connect to an OpenTok session. Add an `app.js` file to the js folder and copy the following to it.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar opentok_api_key\r\nvar opentok_session_id\r\nvar opentok_token\r\nvar azure_face_api_subscription_key\r\nvar azure_face_api_endpoint\r\n// See the config.js file.\r\nif (\r\n  OPENTOK_API_KEY &&\r\n  OPENTOK_SESSION_ID &&\r\n  OPENTOK_TOKEN &&\r\n  AZURE_FACE_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY &&\r\n  AZURE_FACE_API_ENDPOINT\r\n) {\r\n  opentok_api_key = OPENTOK_API_KEY\r\n  opentok_session_id = OPENTOK_SESSION_ID\r\n  opentok_token = OPENTOK_TOKEN\r\n  azure_face_api_subscription_key = AZURE_FACE_API_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY\r\n  azure_face_api_endpoint = AZURE_FACE_API_ENDPOINT\r\n  initializeSession()\r\n} else {\r\n  alert(\r\n    'Failed to get configuration variables. Make sure you have updated the config.js file.'\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n// Handling all of our errors here by logging them to the console\r\nfunction handleError(error) {\r\n  if (error) {\r\n    console.log(error.message)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfunction dataURItoBlob(dataURI) {\r\n  // convert base64/URLEncoded data component to raw binary data held in a string\r\n  var byteString\r\n  if (dataURI.split(',')[0].indexOf('base64') >= 0)\r\n    byteString = atob(dataURI.split(',')[1])\r\n  else byteString = unescape(dataURI.split(',')[1])\r\n  // separate out the mime component\r\n  var mimeString = dataURI.split(',')[0].split(':')[1].split(';')[0]\r\n  // write the bytes of the string to a typed array\r\n  var ia = new Uint8Array(byteString.length)\r\n  for (var i = 0; i \u003C byteString.length; i++) {\r\n    ia[i] = byteString.charCodeAt(i)\r\n  }\r\n  return new Blob([ia], { type: mimeString })\r\n}\r\nvar streams = []\r\nvar emotions = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nFour things are going on here:\r\n\r\n1. We load variables based on those we specified in the `config.js` file\r\n2. We create a `handleError` method that we'll use throughout when an error occurs\r\n3. We add a `dataURItoBlob` method that we'll use to convert a base64/URLEncoded image to a blob for sending to Azure Face API\r\n4. We added two arrays named `streams` and `emotions`\r\n\r\nThe `streams` array will hold all active participant streams so we can access them to capture images to send to the Azure Face API.\r\n\r\nThe `emotions` array will hold strings that represent any emotions returned by Azure Face API. This will be used to display a legend of emojis to the user dynamically.\r\n\r\n### Initializing the OpenTok Session\r\n\r\nAdd the `initializeSession` method below to the bottom of the `app.js` file.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction initializeSession() {\r\n  var session = OT.initSession(opentok_api_key, opentok_session_id)\r\n  // Subscribe to a newly created streams and add\r\n  // them to our collection of active streams.\r\n  session.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\r\n    streams.push(event.stream)\r\n    session.subscribe(\r\n      event.stream,\r\n      'subscriber',\r\n      {\r\n        insertMode: 'append',\r\n      },\r\n      handleError\r\n    )\r\n  })\r\n  // Remove streams from our array when they are destroyed.\r\n  session.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\r\n    streams = streams.filter((f) => f.id !== event.stream.id)\r\n  })\r\n  // Create a publisher\r\n  var publisher = OT.initPublisher(\r\n    'publisher',\r\n    {\r\n      insertMode: 'append',\r\n    },\r\n    handleError\r\n  )\r\n  // Connect to the session\r\n  session.connect(opentok_token, function (error) {\r\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\r\n    if (error) {\r\n      handleError(error)\r\n    } else {\r\n      session.publish(publisher, handleError)\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `initializeSession` method initializes our OpenTok client with the session we specified with the Session ID. It then adds event handlers for the `streamCreated` and `streamDestroyed` events to manage adding and removing streams from our `streams` array. Finally, it connects to the session using the Token we set in our `config.js` file.\r\n\r\nYou can now open the `index.html` in Chrome or Firefox. When you load the page, you may need to allow the browser to access your webcam and microphone. After that, you should see a video stream of yourself (or whatever your webcam is looking at) displaying on the page.\r\n\r\nIf that worked, mute your audio then open another tab (keeping the original open) and load the same file. You should now be able to see a second video.\r\n\r\n> **Troubleshooting tip:** If there's no video showing up on the page, open the \"console\" tab in your browser tools (command+option+i on Mac, CTRL+i on Windows) and check for errors. The most likely issue is that your OpenTok API key, session ID, or token is not set up properly. Since you hardcoded your credentials, it's also possible that your token has expired.\r\n\r\n## I Know That Look\r\n\r\nNow we can see and hear participants, but what is their face telling us that their mouth isn't? Let's add a button that allows us to analyze each participant.\r\n\r\nIn the `index.html` file, replace the comment that says `\u003C!-- Footer will go here -->` with the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003Cfooter>\r\n  \u003Cbutton id=\"analyze\" type=\"button\" onclick=\"processImages();\">Analyze\u003C/button>\r\n\r\n  \u003Cul>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-angry\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-angry\">\u003C/i> Angry\u003C/li>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-frowning\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-frowning\">\u003C/i> Contempt\u003C/li>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-face_vomiting\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-face_vomiting\">\u003C/i> Disgust\u003C/li>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-fearful\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-fearful\">\u003C/i> Fear\u003C/li>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-grin\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-grin\">\u003C/i> Happiness\u003C/li>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-neutral_face\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-neutral_face\">\u003C/i> Neutral\u003C/li>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-cry\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-cry\">\u003C/i> Sadness\u003C/li>\r\n    \u003Cli name=\"em-astonished\">\u003Ci class=\"em em-astonished\">\u003C/i> Surprise\u003C/li>\r\n  \u003C/ul>\r\n\u003C/footer>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis adds a footer at the bottom of the page with an \"Analyze\" button and an unordered list that we'll use as a legend between emojis and sentiments.\r\n\r\nNow let's add the JavaScript to handle our sentiment analysis. Add the following to the bottom of the `app.js` file.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction assignEmoji(emojiClass, index) {\r\n  var widgets = document.getElementsByClassName('OT_widget-container')\r\n  emotions.push(emojiClass)\r\n  var sentimentDiv = document.createElement('div')\r\n  sentimentDiv.classList.add('sentiment')\r\n  sentimentDiv.classList.add('em')\r\n  sentimentDiv.classList.add(emojiClass)\r\n  widgets[index].appendChild(sentimentDiv)\r\n  const legendEl = document.getElementsByName(emojiClass)\r\n  legendEl[0].classList.add('used')\r\n}\r\nfunction processEmotion(faces, index) {\r\n  // for each face identified in the result\r\n  for (i = 0; i \u003C faces.length; i++) {\r\n    const maxEmotion = Object.entries(faces[i].faceAttributes.emotion).reduce(\r\n      (memo, [key, value]) => (memo[1] > value ? memo : [key, value])\r\n    )\r\n    let emojiClass = 'em-neutral_face'\r\n    switch (maxEmotion[0]) {\r\n      case 'angry':\r\n        emojiClass = 'em-angry'\r\n        break\r\n      case 'contempt':\r\n        emojiClass = 'em-frowning'\r\n        break\r\n      case 'disgust':\r\n        emojiClass = 'em-face_vomiting'\r\n        break\r\n      case 'fear':\r\n        emojiClass = 'em-fearful'\r\n        break\r\n      case 'happiness':\r\n        emojiClass = 'em-grin'\r\n        break\r\n      case 'sadness':\r\n        emojiClass = 'em-cry'\r\n        break\r\n      case 'surprise':\r\n        emojiClass = 'em-astonished'\r\n        break\r\n      default:\r\n        break\r\n    }\r\n    assignEmoji(emojiClass, index)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n// Gets a \u003Cvideo> element and draws it to a new\r\n// canvas object. Then creates a jpeg blob from that\r\n// canvas and sends to Azure Face API to get emotion\r\n// data.\r\nfunction sendToAzure(video, index) {\r\n  // Get the stream object associated with this\r\n  // \u003Cvideo> element.\r\n  var stream = streams[index]\r\n  var canvas = document.createElement('canvas')\r\n  canvas.height = stream.videoDimensions.height\r\n  canvas.width = stream.videoDimensions.width\r\n  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')\r\n  ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)\r\n  var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.8)\r\n  var blob = dataURItoBlob(dataURL)\r\n  var fd = new FormData(document.forms[0])\r\n  fd.append('canvasImage', blob)\r\n  // Perform the REST API call.\r\n  var uriBase = `${azure_face_api_endpoint}/face/v1.0/detect`\r\n  // Request parameters.\r\n  var params =\r\n    'returnFaceId=true&returnFaceLandmarks=false&returnFaceAttributes=emotion'\r\n  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()\r\n  xhr.open('POST', `${uriBase}?${params}`)\r\n  xhr.responseType = 'json'\r\n  xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/octet-stream')\r\n  xhr.setRequestHeader(\r\n    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key',\r\n    azure_face_api_subscription_key\r\n  )\r\n  xhr.send(blob)\r\n  xhr.onload = () => {\r\n    if (xhr.status == 200) {\r\n      processEmotion(xhr.response, index)\r\n    } else {\r\n      var errorString = `(${xhr.status}) ${xhr.statusText}`\r\n      alert(errorString)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n// Reset emojis and loop through all \u003Cvideo> elements and call\r\n// sendToAzure\r\nfunction processImages() {\r\n  emotions = []\r\n  var sentiments = document.getElementsByClassName('sentiment')\r\n  var usedListItems = document.getElementsByClassName('used')\r\n  var videos = document.getElementsByTagName('video')\r\n  // Remove any existing sentiment & emotion objects\r\n  if (sentiments.length > 0) {\r\n    for (s = 0; s \u003C sentiments.length; s++) {\r\n      sentiments[s].remove()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  if (usedListItems.length > 0) {\r\n    for (l = 0; l \u003C usedListItems.length; l++) {\r\n      usedListItems[l].classList.remove('used')\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  for (v = 0; v \u003C videos.length - 1; v++) {\r\n    sendToAzure(videos[v], v)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's review what this code does.\r\n\r\nThe `assignEmoji` method takes in a CSS class associated with the emotion for a specific video stream and the index of that stream in our UI. It does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Adds the provided class to our `emotions` array\r\n2. Adds a div over the appropriate video panel with the class for the emoji to display\r\n3. Adds a `used` class to the `li` in our footer for that emoji so that it will display in the legend\r\n\r\nThe `processEmotion` method receives the payload of face data from the Azure Face API and identifies the emotion with the highest ranking. It then calls `assignEmoji` with the appropriate CSS class for that emotion and the index of the video it is processing.\r\n\r\nThe `sendToAzure` method receives an HTML video element and the index of that video object on our page. It gets the stream associated with that video element and then creates an HTML canvas in the same dimensions as the stream. Next, it draws a capture of the stream to the new canvas and sends an XMLHttpRequest to the Azure Face API with the image it created. The Azure Face API will return a JSON object that we will then send to the `processEmotion` method.\r\n\r\nLastly, the `processImages` method clears any existing emojis from the UI and gets all HTML video tags in the DOM and sends them to the `sendToAzure` method to be processed. This method is called by our \"Analyze\" button in the footer.\r\n\r\n## What Are You Really Thinking?\r\n\r\nNow when we open the `index.html` page in our browsers we can press the \"Analyze\" button to see what emotion Azure's Face API has identified. There are a few limitations at the moment. For instance, if Azure Face API recognizes two faces in the frame it will return data for both, but our code currently only adds an emoji for the first.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not certain, but it may not work for teenagers. I made my teenage daughter test it dozens of times but it only returned \"disgust\" and \"contempt\" as the emotions. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Maybe it's better to not know what they really think. 😂\r\n\r\n![Four video frames of Michael showing different sentiments returned from Azure's Face API](https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650129058/blog/sentiment-analysis-with-opentok-and-azure-face-api/sentiment.png)\r\n\r\n## Further Reading\r\n\r\nWant to learn more about using sentiment analysis with Nexmo?

It does the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Adds the provided class to our \u003Ccode>emotions\u003C/code> array\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Adds a div over the appropriate video panel with the class for the emoji to display\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Adds a \u003Ccode>used\u003C/code> class to the \u003Ccode>li\u003C/code> in our footer for that emoji so that it will display in the legend\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Ccode>processEmotion\u003C/code> method receives the payload of face data from the Azure Face API and identifies the emotion with the highest ranking. It then calls \u003Ccode>assignEmoji\u003C/code> with the appropriate CSS class for that emotion and the index of the video it is processing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Ccode>sendToAzure\u003C/code> method receives an HTML video element and the index of that video object on our page. It gets the stream associated with that video element and then creates an HTML canvas in the same dimensions as the stream. Next, it draws a capture of the stream to the new canvas and sends an XMLHttpRequest to the Azure Face API with the image it created. The Azure Face API will return a JSON object that we will then send to the \u003Ccode>processEmotion\u003C/code> method.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lastly, the \u003Ccode>processImages\u003C/code> method clears any existing emojis from the UI and gets all HTML video tags in the DOM and sends them to the \u003Ccode>sendToAzure\u003C/code> method to be processed. This method is called by our “Analyze” button in the footer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"what-are-you-really-thinking\">What Are You Really Thinking?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Now when we open the \u003Ccode>index.html\u003C/code> page in our browsers we can press the “Analyze” button to see what emotion Azure’s Face API has identified. There are a few limitations at the moment. For instance, if Azure Face API recognizes two faces in the frame it will return data for both, but our code currently only adds an emoji for the first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, I’m not certain, but it may not work for teenagers. I made my teenage daughter test it dozens of times but it only returned “disgust” and “contempt” as the emotions. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea. Maybe it’s better to not know what they really think. 😂\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dk3rdh3yo/image/upload/v1650129058/blog/sentiment-analysis-with-opentok-and-azure-face-api/sentiment.png\" alt=\"Four video frames of Michael showing different sentiments returned from Azure&#x27;s Face API\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"further-reading\">Further Reading\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Want to learn more about using sentiment analysis with Nexmo?

This week is full of new tech news and some really cool gadgets.\r\n\r\nOn another note, I read a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson this week that really made me reassess my mindset. He said:\r\n\r\n> The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.\r\n\r\nI found myself arguing with Ralph (yes, in my mind we're on a first name basis.) But the more I let my brain digest it, the more I agreed and realized how important the \"you decided to be\" is to the quote. It then reminded me of another quote that I've seen attributed to many sources, \"Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right.\"\r\n\r\nThe key is deciding who the person is you want to be. Once you have that, every decision made, action taken, and word spoken should be viewed through the lens of that person. Does this choice/word/etc. move me closer or further from that person.\r\n\r\nIt's quite liberating when you think about it. It's much easier to say yes or no and feel confident in your decision. As I've been mulling it over, I've definitely removed some things from my daily routines and added others.\r\n\r\nTake some time this week to think about the person you want to be.

I’m back again with tons of interesting finds. This week is full of new tech news and some really cool gadgets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On another note, I read a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson this week that really made me reassess my mindset.

But the more I let my brain digest it, the more I agreed and realized how important the “you decided to be” is to the quote. It then reminded me of another quote that I’ve seen attributed to many sources, “Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The key is deciding who the person is you want to be. Once you have that, every decision made, action taken, and word spoken should be viewed through the lens of that person. Does this choice/word/etc. move me closer or further from that person.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s quite liberating when you think about it. It’s much easier to say yes or no and feel confident in your decision.

I'm terrible at it. I end up procrastinating until the last minute and then crunching to get it done on time. While I get the job done, often times it's to the detriment of family time, sleep, healthy eating, or exercise.\r\n\r\nOf course, working from home with a staff of me, it's easy for things to get pushed back constantly. A few months ago, realizing I needed some accountability, I posted a to-do list of 5 things that I needed to prioritize to a small group of friends in Discord. I asked for them to push me on them. (Boy, did they deliver. 😁) But honestly, it was super helpful. Because I knew someone was going to ask what progress I was making, I was able to focus and get things done.\r\n\r\nSince then, I've done the same thing a few times, but even better, I've seen people in Discord start to use the same tactic. We've got a solid group of folks taking charge of their health, from bike rides, eating healthier, daily walks, to insane push-up challenges, we're all holding each other accountable and being vulnerable enough to share that we need help. Holy frijole! It's amazing what we can accomplish together.\r\n\r\nIf you're missing something like that in your life, I really want to encourage you to find it. I'm certainly biased, the Build with Me Discord is a great place to start. Come on in, encourage others, and when you're ready, ask others to help hold you accountable to your goals, whatever they are.\r\n\r\nAs always, hope your week is great and if I can help with anything, hit me up on the socials.\r\n\r\nUntil next time!\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n## Interesting Finds\r\n\r\n- [TypeChat](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeChat/): Hopefully, you've had time to play with LLM's like ChatGPT. But playing asking them questions for fun and building an application on top of them are two different things. That's where TypeChat steps in. In simplest terms, it allows TypeScript developers to get well-typed responses from LLMs that can be used programmatically.\r\n- [​Flutter 3.13](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-13-479d9b11df4d): I was talking to a friend who runs a custom software shop this past week. They used to be focused on Angular/Vue front-ends powered by .NET API backends, but now they've moved 90% of their work to Flutter & Dart. I may give it a try just to get a feel for it, but they are loving the experience. Turns out there's a new release this week that makes several improvements to their graphics renderer.\r\n- [​Using the .NET MAUI Extension for VS Code](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/beyond-basics-getting-started-net-maui-extension-visual-studio-code): I mentioned this extension a few weeks ago and actually tried it out on stream, but the folks at Telerik put together a great \"Beyond the Basics\" post to help you try it out faster. I could have really used this before I installed it.\r\n- [​Sailhouse Pub/Sub](https://sailhouse.dev/): Build a system with significant integrations or scale and you'll find yourself needing some type of pub/sub, service bus, etc. infrastructure. Sailhouse is a new beta product that aims to make pub/sub much easier. No more worries about infra, clusters, regions, and so on.\r\n- [How Google Measures Developer Productivity](https://newsletter.abinoda.com/p/how-google-measures-productivity): An interview with Google Engineering Productivity Researchers Ciera Jaspan and Collin Green on how their team defines and measures developer productivity at Google. While they have a lot more resources than most development teams, there are some quality insights to take and apply on a smaller scale everywhere.\r\n- [Node.js 20 is now available](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce): A couple new features include a new permission model that feels inspired by Deno and a built-in test runner which will make testing Node.js applications easier. The test runner may remove the need for 3rd party packages. There's other features and movement around performance, Web Crypto API, and WASI, but I'm looking forward to testing the test runner more than anything else.\r\n- [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio/): I've been playing with Nuxt Studio for a few weeks and it's a fantastic tool for learning Nuxt. You'll need to give it access to your GitHub account, but it sets up a Nuxt site for you using pre-built templates and allows you to manage the site from a nice web-based GUI.\r\n- [Defeating Procrastination via Walking](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-defeat-procrastination-via-walking?source=rss): I admit that I can procrastinate with the best of them. I read this Saturday and I'm looking forward to giving it a try next week. I've actually been thinking if weight training would have a similar effect. I have some dumbbells in my office that I could grab. Let me know if you've tried this or how it works for you if you do.\r\n- [15 Terrible Pieces of Advice for Web Developers](https://fadamakis.com/15-terrible-advice-for-web-developers-e821e95f5d18): This blog post reminded me of nightmares of years past. Of course, all these pieces of advice are terrible, and you should actually do the opposite, but I bet we've all met someone who did one or more of these. If you don't know that person... well, you probably are that person. 😁\r\n- [Hacking a Teddy Ruxpin](https://learn.adafruit.com/teddy-ruxpin-rebuild/overview): I remember Teddy Ruxpin bears when I was a kid, but I didn't realize they're still around. Honestly, I never cared for them. I was already too old for them when they were released. But this project... I may have to consider for my kids.\r\n\r\n## Build with Me Weekly\r\n\r\nThis week in the Build with Me Community:\r\n\r\n### Community Content\r\n\r\n- Zelcion shared [Meta-System](https://mapikit.github.io/meta-system-docs/), a project he's been working on for 3 years.

I’m terrible at it. I end up procrastinating until the last minute and then crunching to get it done on time. While I get the job done, often times it’s to the detriment of family time, sleep, healthy eating, or exercise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of course, working from home with a staff of me, it’s easy for things to get pushed back constantly. A few months ago, realizing I needed some accountability, I posted a to-do list of 5 things that I needed to prioritize to a small group of friends in Discord. I asked for them to push me on them. (Boy, did they deliver. 😁) But honestly, it was super helpful. Because I knew someone was going to ask what progress I was making, I was able to focus and get things done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since then, I’ve done the same thing a few times, but even better, I’ve seen people in Discord start to use the same tactic. We’ve got a solid group of folks taking charge of their health, from bike rides, eating healthier, daily walks, to insane push-up challenges, we’re all holding each other accountable and being vulnerable enough to share that we need help. Holy frijole! It’s amazing what we can accomplish together.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you’re missing something like that in your life, I really want to encourage you to find it. I’m certainly biased, the Build with Me Discord is a great place to start. Come on in, encourage others, and when you’re ready, ask others to help hold you accountable to your goals, whatever they are.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As always, hope your week is great and if I can help with anything, hit me up on the socials.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Until next time!\r\nMichael\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"interesting-finds\">Interesting Finds\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/TypeChat/\">TypeChat\u003C/a>: Hopefully, you’ve had time to play with LLM’s like ChatGPT. But playing asking them questions for fun and building an application on top of them are two different things. That’s where TypeChat steps in. In simplest terms, it allows TypeScript developers to get well-typed responses from LLMs that can be used programmatically.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-13-479d9b11df4d\">​Flutter 3.13\u003C/a>: I was talking to a friend who runs a custom software shop this past week. They used to be focused on Angular/Vue front-ends powered by .NET API backends, but now they’ve moved 90% of their work to Flutter &#x26; Dart. I may give it a try just to get a feel for it, but they are loving the experience.

The test runner may remove the need for 3rd party packages. There’s other features and movement around performance, Web Crypto API, and WASI, but I’m looking forward to testing the test runner more than anything else.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://nuxt.studio/\">Nuxt Studio\u003C/a>: I’ve been playing with Nuxt Studio for a few weeks and it’s a fantastic tool for learning Nuxt.

That said, there was a ton of stuff going on this week, so I hope you enjoy the collection of finds.\r\n\r\nUntil next time!\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n## Interesting Finds\r\n\r\n- [​Analog.js](https://analogjs.org/): React has Next.js. Vue has Nuxt.js. Where's the love for our Angular friends? [Brandon Roberts](https://twitter.com/brandontroberts) has the answer with Analog.js.\r\n- [​Goodbye Visual Studio for Mac](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/): Microsoft announced that as of August 2024, Visual Studio for Mac will be retired. They are clearly pushing for those developers to move to VS Code using the new C# Dev Kit & .NET MAUI extensions that were shared in previous Brain Dumps.\r\n- [​Astro 3.0:](https://astro.build/blog/astro-3/) If you've seen any of my streams, you know I love Astro and this week they released the new version 3.0. Highlights include built-in View Transitions, faster rendering, image optimization and more.\r\n- [​History of Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-on-open-at-microsoft/): I've always been a primarily Windows user and I've absolutely loved Windows Terminal. This post & video about the history of the journey Windows Terminal took to becoming open source was great.\r\n- [​InversifyJS](https://inversify.io/): Dependency injection in .NET is very common, but I hadn't seen it used a lot in JavaScript (outside of frontend frameworks) until recently. InversifyJS is a great IoC for building solid, OOP applications with JavaScript or TypeScript.\r\n- [​Fast Endpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com/): I recently tried out .NET Minimal APIs. I liked the simplification of route creation, but Fast Endpoints takes that to another level. It's another way of building Minimal APIs, with similar performance, but using less memory and around 35K more requests per second than .NET MVC Controllers.\r\n- [​Astro announces Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build/): Due to launch in 2024, Astro Studio is a globally-distributed edge data platform, built for Astro. Connect any new or existing Astro project to a dedicated hosted database in seconds. It's fast everywhere, secure, and unbelievably easy-to-use.\r\n- [​Rome forked to become Biome.js](https://biomejs.dev/): Imagine a developer toolchain that removes the need for Babel, ESLint, webpack, Prettier, Jest, and more. That's what Biome hopes to provide.\r\n- [​ViteConf 2023](https://viteconf.org/23/): ViteConf is coming this October. It's a virtual conference focusing on all things powered by Vite. Registration is free.\r\n- [​Starship](https://starship.rs/): Starship is a must-install when I setup a new machine. It's a customizable prompt for any shell.

At least it is for me. I recently went through a focus/goal setting session where I had to think about what things are important to me. Maybe it's paying for your kids' college tuition, so they aren't saddled with debt on graduation. Maybe it's to reach a certain salary or title. Maybe it's spending more time with family. I went through all types prioritizing what mattered most to me. From professional, personal, health, spiritual, emotional, all the things/goals.\r\n\r\nI know I can't achieve all my goals at the same time, so once I had them written down, I sorted them by importance. I wanted to target the top 3 to 5 that I think I can move the needle on in the next 6 months to a year. Then for each, I defined sequential goals within them. As an example, if a goal was to be 50 pounds lighter, then those subgoals would be \"lose 10 pounds,\" \"lose 20 pounds,\" etc. Once I had all those subgoals defined, I thought about what actions I could take to achieve them. To continue with the example, to \"lose 10 pounds,\" I could exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes 6 days a week, and meal-prep breakfasts & lunches for all weekdays. Those \"actions\" turned into daily tasks for me to accomplish, knowing that if I do them, I should progress and hopefully achieve the subgoal.\r\n\r\nThis was the first week of being intentional to do each of my daily tasks and it was a rousing success. Only one goal wasn't done at all this week. That goal? Washing the dishes each day. I'm still recovering from a bad cold (that my wife & I believe was actually a mild case of Covid) and she has prevented me from doing it because she doesn't want my germs all over the dishes. So, maybe next week. 😁\r\n\r\nIt's hard to stay focused on doing only those things that really matter to you. How do you make sure you're doing things that are moving you or your project forward?

This was a great read on how to not sabotage your negotiations.\r\n- [​DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys): If you're a developer on a Windows machine, you need DevToys. It's an app that provides so many tools for developers that consolidates all those things you Google for regularly, like cron parsers, tons of encoders/decoders, JSON/XML/etc. formatters, and hash, UUID, Lorem ipsum generators. That's not all either.\r\n- [Bun is officially version 1.0](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0): Don't let the fact that the Bun logo looks more like an onion fool you, this Node.js & Deno replacement is amazing. Transpilers for TypeScript, JSX, and more are built in, as are bundlers & test libraries. Not to mention, build speeds are insanely more performant than Node & Deno.\r\n- [Turbo 8 is dropping TypeScript](https://world.hey.com/dhh/turbo-8-is-dropping-typescript-70165c01): Big news in the tech world this week when DHH announced that Turbo was dropping TypeScript. This has been a very controversial decision and time will tell if this hurts the Turbo community. One thing's for sure, if you're a TypeScript dev in that world, your work just got a little less nice.\r\n- [Cursor - The AI-first Code Editor](https://www.cursor.so/): If you're using VS Code, you may love Cursor. Cursor is a fork of VS Code with AI built in. That means all your settings, extensions, etc. transfer seamlessly, but now you can ask your IDE to write code for you, add tests for a function or ask where in your code \"X\" happens. It will be interesting to see how VS Code adapts to adopt some of this functionality\r\n- [​GitHub Universe is back!](https://githubuniverse.com/): Coming in hot this November, it's GitHub Universe. I always enjoy seeing what new things GitHub has in store for developers. I'm anticipating some enhancements to CoPilot, and perhaps upgrades to Codespaces.\r\n- [​Node.js 20 is moving in the right direction](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.6.0): It's clear that alternatives like Deno & Bun are causing Node.js to put more effort into developer experience. Node.js 20 has caught my eye in a big way with built-in .env file support.\r\n- [No more WordPad on Windows!?](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/3/23857331/microsoft-wordpad-windows-removal-end-of-support): Honestly, I don't remember the last time I opened WordPad. If it's on my Windows machine, I wouldn't know it. I always choose NotePad. When's the last time you used WordPad.\r\n- [​FreeCodeCamp's Prompt Engineering Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZvnD73m40o): Ania Kubow put together a great YouTube course on prompt engineering. If you're interested in learning how to better prompt ChatGPT or other LLMs, this is a great starting point.\r\n\r\n## Build with Me Weekly\r\n\r\nThis week in the Build with Me Community:\r\n\r\n### Thankful Thursday Highlights\r\n\r\n> I should get a retainer today!

I'm reminded of something someone told me a long time ago: \"this too shall pass.\" He was speaking about \"times.\" Having a hard time? \"This too shall pass.\" Things going fantastic? \"This too shall pass.\" The point was, no matter what you're going through, we will all experience peaks and valleys in life.\r\n​\r\nThe one thing that doesn't have to change is how you respond. I read a study recently that stress isn't necessarily detrimental to health. Most of us think differently, but this study showed that how people responded to stress could be beneficial for your health. Those who perceived a stressful situation as an opportunity for growth & learning, actually experienced beneficial health effects, while those who felt dread, anxiety, and fear experienced detrimental effects.\r\n\r\nMy kids and I talk about this often. Here in the US, even the poorest of us are still in the top 1% of the world's population in terms of wealth and health. So, in every situation, we try to maintain a perspective of gratitude. That doesn't mean we can't be sad. It doesn't mean we don't feel anxiety or depression. It just means, in all those circumstances, we try to recalibrate our thoughts on gratitude.\r\n\r\nAnywho, not sure how \"hope your week went well\" turned into three paragraphs of a gratitude rant. 😁\r\n\r\nOh well, I do hope your week went well, and if not, I hope the tide turns quickly for you.\r\n\r\nSee you next week.\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n## Interesting Finds\r\n\r\n- [​How to Use Dependency Injection with NodeJS](https://amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-dependency-injection-with-nodejs): Developers in languages like Java and .NET have been doing dependency injection for years, but did you know it's possible with NodeJS.

I’m reminded of something someone told me a long time ago: “this too shall pass.” He was speaking about “times.” Having a hard time? “This too shall pass.” Things going fantastic? “This too shall pass.” The point was, no matter what you’re going through, we will all experience peaks and valleys in life.\r\n​\r\nThe one thing that doesn’t have to change is how you respond. I read a study recently that stress isn’t necessarily detrimental to health. Most of us think differently, but this study showed that how people responded to stress could be beneficial for your health. Those who perceived a stressful situation as an opportunity for growth &#x26; learning, actually experienced beneficial health effects, while those who felt dread, anxiety, and fear experienced detrimental effects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My kids and I talk about this often. Here in the US, even the poorest of us are still in the top 1% of the world’s population in terms of wealth and health. So, in every situation, we try to maintain a perspective of gratitude. That doesn’t mean we can’t be sad. It doesn’t mean we don’t feel anxiety or depression. It just means, in all those circumstances, we try to recalibrate our thoughts on gratitude.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Anywho, not sure how “hope your week went well” turned into three paragraphs of a gratitude rant. 😁\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh well, I do hope your week went well, and if not, I hope the tide turns quickly for you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>See you next week.\r\nMichael\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"interesting-finds\">Interesting Finds\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-dependency-injection-with-nodejs\">​How to Use Dependency Injection with NodeJS\u003C/a>: Developers in languages like Java and .NET have been doing dependency injection for years, but did you know it’s possible with NodeJS.

I'm looking forward to a few live streams on Twitch this week and a special video drop later this week. Honestly, it's one of the most fun projects I've worked on in a long time and has really got my creative juices flowing.\r\n\r\nBut the whole process had me thinking \"this is totally how my mind works. I was made for this.\" Have you ever felt that way about something? I wonder how many people work to fund the things they're really passionate about versus those who get to do what they're passionate about for a living. Where would you say you fall on that spectrum? DM me on X [@michaeljolley](https://twitter.com/michaeljolley) and let me know. Also, tell me what really gets you excited, even if it's not tech related. I love hearing people talk about the things that excite them.\r\n\r\nHeck, I spent an hour explaining the rotation of the Earth around the sun and its axis to my 7-year-old son yesterday.

I love the ability to really mod and upgrade your laptop as it ages. In this video, the components of a Framework laptop are used to build a StreamDeck clone that can run Windows.\r\n- [​Ampt has officially launched](https://getampt.com/): Like other platforms (Netlify/Vercel), Ampt is built on top of AWS, and makes it easier to build Node.js applications that run in the cloud. It really seems like building a Node.js app in a container and running it there, without the containerization part.\r\n- [​The Code that Makes Mario Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuKIUjw_tNU): Chris in our Discord shared this video last week and it was so cool to watch. I love the old Mario, Zelda & Tetris games, so seeing the code behind it is always awesome.\r\n- [​DarkMatter](https://getdarkmatter.dev/): If you have contributors to your Astro site that aren't experienced with Git or IDE's, DarkMatter might be the answer. It's a Mac-only app that allows users to edit Astro content collections in a WYSIWYG editor.\r\n- [publint](https://publint.dev/): When it comes to publishing new packages, publint is my new best friend. It downloads a packages tarball into a web worker and runs publint against it to let you know if the package is published correctly. It also provides suggested changes to make the package better.\r\n- [​TLDR Newsletter](https://sparklp.co/p/e803c8fd12): TLDR is a daily email sent to over a million subscribers daily. I really appreciate that it isn't massive so I can get a taste of what's going on in tech each morning with very little lift on my part.\r\n- [​Are The Types Wrong!?](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/): If you're building with TypeScript the last thing you want to do is install a package to find out it doesn't include types. In fact, the only thing worse is when the included types are wrong. Are The Types Wrong lets you review any npm package to test whether types exist and if they're correct.\r\n- [​TypeScript Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6s2pdxebSo): I got to watch the premiere of this last week and it is a fantastic look at how TypeScript came to be and how it grew in the JavaScript community.\r\n- [​JavaScript is getting array grouping methods](https://philna.sh/blog/2023/09/14/javascript-array-grouping-methods/): Having been a .NET developer for so many years, it's always weird to read articles like this. I can't imagine not having things like LINQ that have existed in .NET for years. That said, these are much overdue additions.\r\n- [​CSS Variables 101](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-vars-101/): When I rebuilt the baldbeardedbuilder.com website, I decided to leave TailwindCSS and Sass behind. I've used them together for years, but with CSS variables I felt like I could probably build a smaller CSS bundle myself, and I was right. If you're not familiar with CSS variables, this is a great getting started guide.\r\n- [​Computer Engineering for BIG Babies](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/babyengineering/computer-engineering-for-big-babies): This Kickstarter project is for an interactive book that teaches electronic circuits. The original was an amazing book, and this revision definitely takes it to the next level.\r\n- [​Windows 11, now with Copilot AI](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23882173/microsoft-windows-11-23h2-update-features-release-date): I'm pretty sure everyone saw this coming, and I'm here for it!

I’m looking forward to a few live streams on Twitch this week and a special video drop later this week. Honestly, it’s one of the most fun projects I’ve worked on in a long time and has really got my creative juices flowing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But the whole process had me thinking “this is totally how my mind works. I was made for this.” Have you ever felt that way about something? I wonder how many people work to fund the things they’re really passionate about versus those who get to do what they’re passionate about for a living. Where would you say you fall on that spectrum? DM me on X \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/michaeljolley\">@michaeljolley\u003C/a> and let me know. Also, tell me what really gets you excited, even if it’s not tech related. I love hearing people talk about the things that excite them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Heck, I spent an hour explaining the rotation of the Earth around the sun and its axis to my 7-year-old son yesterday.

Their soundtracks were definitely the soundtracks of my pre-teen years, but this joker isn't playing the theme of DOOM. He's actually playing the game with a guitar. Amazing!\r\n- [​Notion icons](https://uno.notion.vip/icons/): I use Notion a ton, but also love for my workspace to look good. (I know, it doesn't make any difference, but it makes me happy.) I use these icons a ton in my workspace and it makes my work a little more enjoyable.\r\n- [Add conversational AI to your app](https://dasha.ai/en-us): Want users to be able to speak to your app to get things done? Dasha is a conversational-AI-as-a-service platform that makes it easier to add conversational AI to your app. Pretty cool.\r\n- [​A multiplayer code editor!?](https://zed.dev/): Zed was built by the creators of Atom and Tree-Sitter and provides an IDE with pair/group programming in mind. The interface seems very inspired by VS Code, but the \"social\" aspect is pretty interesting. I'm not sure how much use that would get outside of teams, but I love having VS Code competitors to keep the space innovating.\r\n- [​Integrating Notion with an Astro site](https://baldbeardedbuilder.com/blog/integrating-notion-with-astro-sites/?utm_source=brain-dump): I mentioned how much I use Notion. No seriously, I use it for everything. But I wanted to show some of the information there, like my upcoming content schedule, to show on my website built with Astro. So, I built an integration that lists the next 5 streams, YouTube videos, or blog posts on the homepage. Then I wrote a blog post to remind myself how to do it in the future.\r\n- [​Is dotenv dead?](https://francoisbest.com/posts/2023/dotenv-is-dead): I shared in a previous Brain Dump that Node.js 20.6.0 brings built-in .env file support, but shares that with a bonus way of strongly typing your environment with Zod. I love this and am already thinking of ways to use this moving forward.\r\n- [​VS Code September 2023 release is out](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_83): Another month, another VS Code release. This month includes better accessibility, improved grouping of command palette items, and more.\r\n- [​A complete guide to the CSS :has() selector](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/css-has-selector/): We've been able to select children in CSS using selectors like :nth-child(), :first-child(), etc. but finally we have access to the parents.

Last week was one of the most productive weeks I've had in a while, both professionally and personally. It's made me super pumped for the upcoming week. I'm looking for some open-source repos to contribute to for Hacktoberfest. Got any you think I should look at? Send me a message on Twitter or Discord!\r\n\r\nAre you planning on contributing to Hacktoberfest this year? I always enjoy it and wish there were local events that I could join in on. Maybe next year I should organize one. Speaking of in-person events, have you ever been to one? Whether a conference or local meetup. I normally hate traveling but I'm eyeing some events within driving distance for the next 6-12 months.\r\n\r\nAnywho, have an awesome week and I'll catch you next week.\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n## Interesting Finds\r\n\r\n- ​[The Raspberry Pi 5 is finally here!](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23889238/raspberry-pi-5-specs-availability-pricing): It blew my mind to think that the Raspberry Pi 4 was released 4 years ago. Of course, the pandemic has totally destroyed my sense of time for the past 5ish years. With PCIe 2.0 support and two hybrid camera/monitor ports, this thing looks nice!\r\n- [​One Thing Nobody Explained to You About TypeScript](https://kettanaito.com/blog/one-thing-nobody-explained-to-you-about-typescript): Let's be real. When you started using TypeScript, you just created a .ts file and started typing. Maybe the project you were working in had a tsconfig.json file, but has anyone ever thought about what that file is and why it matters? This post does the best job I've ever seen describing its importance and how it works.\r\n- [​Learn the Astro Web Framework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-astro-web-framework/): James Q. Quick released a great crash course on Astro via FreeCodeCamp this week. James is preparing to launch an in-depth paid Astro course, and this is a great short-form overview of the content you'll find there.\r\n- [​ChatGPT is officially multi-modal](https://www.hiphops.io/news/chatgpt-is-now-officially-multimodal-openai-announces-it-can-now-see-hear-and-speak): Since it was released, we've all been typing our prompts into ChatGPT and have been amazed at what it produces. But now, we can also prompt it via images and/or voice. Of course, using a combination of text, speech and images may produce the best results yet.\r\n- [​Rust Vs Go: A Hands-On Comparison](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2023/09/27/rust-vs-go-comparison#a-rust-web-service): When I started learning Go a few weeks ago, one of the most common questions I received was \"why didn't you learn Rust?\" I didn't have a good answer. I'd just heard that Go was easier to pick up and there had been some uneasiness within the Rust community for a while. There isn't a right answer, but this blog post was the most comprehensive thing I've ever read on the differences & similarities between the two, with practical examples of building the same thing in each language.\r\n- [​GitHub opens Copilot Chat to all developers](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/2023/sep/21/github-opens-copilot-chat-all-developers/): Released to business developers a few months ago, GitHub has finally opened the floodgates for everyone to use Copilot Chat.

But now, we can also prompt it via images and/or voice. Of course, using a combination of text, speech and images may produce the best results yet.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2023/09/27/rust-vs-go-comparison#a-rust-web-service\">​Rust Vs Go: A Hands-On Comparison\u003C/a>: When I started learning Go a few weeks ago, one of the most common questions I received was “why didn’t you learn Rust?” I didn’t have a good answer. I’d just heard that Go was easier to pick up and there had been some uneasiness within the Rust community for a while. There isn’t a right answer, but this blog post was the most comprehensive thing I’ve ever read on the differences &#x26; similarities between the two, with practical examples of building the same thing in each language.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.developer-tech.com/news/2023/sep/21/github-opens-copilot-chat-all-developers/\">​GitHub opens Copilot Chat to all developers\u003C/a>: Released to business developers a few months ago, GitHub has finally opened the floodgates for everyone to use Copilot Chat.

Luckily, Frontend Masters releases smaller versions on YouTube to give you a taste of the full course. Also, if you've not used Frontend Masters, you can sign up for free and watch 5 courses completely free, including [this one](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/). If you want to learn more about algorithms this should be your starting point.\r\n- [​Bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno): Think Postman or Insomnia, but with your privacy in mind.

Temporary keys, limited keys, rate limiting, and analytics are all beasts to conquer when building. Unkey provides an open-source alternative for managing user keys.

That said, I'm totally checking them all out to pick my favorite. 😁\r\n\r\nSee you next week!\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n## Interesting Finds\r\n\r\n- [​Introducing Angular v17](https://blog.angular.io/introducing-angular-v17-4d7033312e4b): In addition to a new, pretty cool looking website (although, what's the deal with frameworks using black, silver, and a gradient in their branding right now,) Angular is back! Angular was my first introduction to TypeScript and frontend frameworks. I'm looking forward to playing with the new bits.\r\n- [​OpenAI signals it'll destroy startups using it's tech](https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-signals-destroy-startups-using-its-tech): Got a cool startup idea that you'll use OpenAI for? You might want to rethink that decision. OpenAI has signaled that it has no problem building your app into their product offering.\r\n- [​What I learned getting acquired by Google](https://shreyans.org/google): Having never been at a startup that was acquired, I live vicariously through these types of articles and find them absolutely fascinating.\r\n- [Habits of great software engineers](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/habits-of-great-software-engineers/): There is so much content that is essentially click-bait with 'n ways to be a better JS developer', etc. that it was a pleasant surprise to read a legitimately good article. After 20+ years in engineering, I can vouch for all of these tips.\r\n- [Geist font by Vercel](https://vercel.com/font): Thanks, Vercel. You may not have gotten all the features you wanted in Next.js in the latest releases, but at least you got a font. 🤣\r\n- [Monaspace font by GitHub](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/): Didn't like Geist? That's okay. GitHub wants you to love their new font. Actually, Monaspace is more like a font family with several different styles to choose from. Personally, I'm still deciding between Argon & Krypton.\r\n- [Inshellisense: IDE autocomplete](https://github.com/microsoft/inshellisense): What a cool idea. This Microsoft repository brings intellisense functionality to nearly any terminal you want, including those on Linux & Mac. I cannot wait to install this next week and give it a try.\r\n- [GitHub is betting big on Copilot](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform): Copilot has really increased my productivity in VS Code, and now GitHub is bringing all that goodness to github.com. Here's a rundown of GitHub Universe showcasing all the features that are on the way.\r\n- [Make iTerm2 look fantastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Fi2RcdBFQ): I've been using a new Mac recently, so I've had to go through the whole \"setup\" process. This was a great video to help me get my iTerm2 closer to what I'm used to.\r\n\r\n## Build with Me Weekly\r\n\r\n### Thankful Thursday Highlights\r\n\r\n> Nachos.\r\n>\r\n> -- _Phrakberg_\r\n\r\n> I'm thankful for my Shure SM7B.

I gave it a try last week and I was impressed at how easy they make it. That said, if you're not using it a lot, the pricing seemed a little steep. Also, I'd like to see more animations that I could select from. For example, I'd love to see a \"typing\" effect.\r\n- [​Vite 5.0 is out!](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite5): About a year after version 4, Vite is back again with an update. Some major changes include being powered by Rollup 4, deprecating the CJS API, and changes to the define and import.meta.env strategy.\r\n- [​Introducing .NET Aspire](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-dotnet-aspire-simplifying-cloud-native-development-with-dotnet-8/): I've argued that .NET developers have a happier development lifecycle because there aren't so many competing frameworks for everything. In addition, most of the frameworks and tooling for .NET are very opinionated, which simplifies the learning process for new developers. That said, there are tons of ways to build cloud-native applications in .NET, but in a lot of cases, you can spend as much time on managing services & infrastructure as you spend writing your business logic. .NET Aspire looks to solve this problem.\r\n- [​Astro + Quik](https://www.builder.io/blog/astro-qwik): Slick implementation of using Qwik with Astro to enable resumability in your static websites.\r\n- [​OrbStack is containers the easy way on Mac](https://orbstack.dev/): In my switch to Mac, some Discord community folks recommended OrbStack for containers over Docker. It has been really nice. Just comparing to Docker Desktop on my PC, OrbStack has been very nimble.\r\n- [​OKLCH for better color in the browser](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/oklch-better-color-css-browser): Jason does a great job of explaining how colors work in CSS and why OKLCH is the way to move forward.

I have yet to try it but it looks impressive. I'm not sure how much of what looks cool to me is SvelteKit versus Svelte itself. I haven't used either, but I have some friends that absolutely love Svelte and it may have to be something I play with in 2024.​\r\n- [Multi-platform Apps with .NET with Avalonia​](https://avaloniaui.net/?ref=baldbeardedbuilder): I learned about Avalonia this past week and it looks really cool. Building with .NET, but compiling to applications for Windows, macOS, Linux and the browser via WASM. Plus, the fact that support for visionOS and Tizen are coming soon. Have you tried Avalonia yet? The only thing I'm not in love with is the fact that it uses XAML, but I get it.\r\n- [​Developer Dad Jokes​](https://github.com/michaeljolley/dev-dad-jokes?ref=baldbeardedbuilder): I found an old repo of mine that contains a ton of dad jokes geared to developers.
