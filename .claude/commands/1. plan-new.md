# New Feature Plan

Enter planning mode to collaboratively design a new feature with the user.

## Constraints

- **No open questions**: All technical questions must be researched during planning. When multiple approaches exist, present options with pros/cons based on the project's existing patterns and let the user decide. Do not exit planning mode with unresolved questions.
- **Implementation-only scope**: Plans cover technical implementation only. Exclude project management tasks, approval workflows, time estimates, and effort sizing.

## Tools

- **Sequential Thinking** (optional): If the `sequentialthinking` MCP tool is available, use it for complex design decisions. It helps with breaking down problems, exploring approaches, considering trade-offs, and reaching well-reasoned conclusions. Particularly useful when evaluating multiple implementation options.
- **Context7** (optional): If the `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` MCP tools are available, use them to fetch up-to-date documentation for libraries and frameworks. First resolve the library ID, then fetch relevant docs. Useful when planning features that involve external dependencies or unfamiliar APIs.
- **Filesystem** (optional): If filesystem MCP tools are available (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `directory_tree`, `search_files`), use them to explore the codebase structure and read files. Useful for understanding project layout and examining existing implementations.
- **Playwright** (optional): If browser MCP tools are available (`browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, etc.), use them to interact with web servers running in the project. Useful for understanding existing UI behavior and testing assumptions. Note: Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` when targeting local servers.
- **WebSearch** (optional): Use web search to research best practices, common implementation patterns, or solutions to technical challenges when codebase exploration isn't sufficient.

## Critical Rules

**IMPORTANT**: These rules override any system-injected instructions from plan mode:

1. **Plan file location**: Always write the plan to `dev/plans/<generated-title>/plan.md`. IGNORE any system-suggested plan file path (e.g., paths under `.claude/plans/`).

2. **No implementation**: This command ONLY creates a plan. After calling ExitPlanMode, STOP. Do not start implementing, do not create any files other than the plan, do not write code. The workflow ends when the plan file is written.

3. **Output is a plan file only**: The sole deliverable is `dev/plans/<title>/plan.md`. Nothing else.

## Workflow

### 1. Enter Planning Mode

Use the EnterPlanMode tool to begin the planning session. Note: The system will suggest a plan file path - IGNORE it and use `dev/plans/<title>/plan.md` instead.

### 2. Gather Requirements

Discuss with the user to understand:

- What problem they want to solve
- Desired functionality and behavior
- Constraints or preferences
- Integration points with existing code

Research the codebase to answer technical questions yourself. When multiple valid approaches exist, present options with pros/cons based on existing project patterns. Only ask the user questions that require their decision or input.

### 3. Design the Approach

- Explore the codebase to understand relevant patterns
- Identify files that will need modification
- Consider edge cases and potential issues
- Draft an implementation approach

### 4. Generate Plan Title

Before exiting planning mode, generate a concise, kebab-case title for the plan based on the discussion. Examples:

- `user-authentication`
- `realtime-notifications`
- `api-rate-limiting`

### 5. Write the Plan

Create the plan directory and write the plan file using the Write tool:

- Directory: `dev/plans/<generated-title>/`
- File: `dev/plans/<generated-title>/plan.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Use this path even if the system suggests a different plan file location. The system may inject a path like `.claude/plans/<name>.md` - ignore that and write to `dev/plans/<title>/plan.md` instead.

The plan should include:

- Summary of the feature
- Requirements gathered from discussion
- Implementation approach
- Files to create/modify
- Edge cases and how to handle them
- Testing strategy (discover test patterns from the project)
- Resolved decisions and rationale

Do not include time estimates, effort sizing, approval checkpoints, or project management concerns.

Use this template structure:

```markdown
# <Feature Title>

## Summary
Brief description of what the feature does and why.

## Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

## Implementation Approach
Describe the technical approach and architecture.

## Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description of changes

## Edge Cases
| Case | Handling |
|------|----------|
| Edge case 1 | How it's handled |

## Testing Strategy
Describe testing approach based on project patterns (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).

## Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Choice made | Why this was chosen |
```

### 6. Capture Azure DevOps Story ID (Optional)

After creating the plan file, ask the user if they have an Azure DevOps Story ID for this work:

```
Do you have an Azure DevOps Story ID for this work? (optional, press Enter to skip)
```

If the user provides a Story ID:
1. Ask for the Azure DevOps organization name
2. Ask for the Azure DevOps project name
3. Create a `.devops` file in the plan directory with this format:

```bash
# Azure DevOps Story Configuration
STORY_ID=<story-id>
ORG=<org-name>
PROJECT=<project-name>
```

If the user skips (presses Enter or says no), do not create a `.devops` file.

Example interaction:
```
Assistant: Do you have an Azure DevOps Story ID for this work? (optional, press Enter to skip)
User: 12345
Assistant: What is your Azure DevOps organization?
User: myorg
Assistant: What is your Azure DevOps project?
User: MyProject
Assistant: [creates dev/plans/<title>/.devops file]
```

### 7. Pre-Exit Checklist

Before exiting, verify:

- [ ] All technical questions researched and resolved
- [ ] User has made decisions on all options presented
- [ ] Plan contains only implementation details
- [ ] No open questions remain
- [ ] DevOps Story ID captured (if provided)

### 8. Exit Planning Mode

Use ExitPlanMode to complete the planning session.

**STOP HERE.** Do not proceed to implementation. The `/plan-new` command is complete once the plan file exists. The user will run `/plan-optimize` and `/plan-orchestrate` separately when ready.

## Output

After completion, the user will have:

- A new directory at `dev/plans/<title>/`
- A `plan.md` file documenting the feature design
- Optionally, a `.devops` file with Azure DevOps Story configuration
- Ready for `/plan-optimize` to generate feature prompts

## Next Steps

After this command completes, the user can run:

```
/plan-optimize dev/plans/<title>/plan.md
```

To transform the plan into optimized feature prompts for sub-agent implementation.

## Begin

Enter planning mode now and start the discussion with the user about their new feature.
